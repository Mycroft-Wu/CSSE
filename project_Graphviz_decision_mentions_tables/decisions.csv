(not sure why it is not part of https://github.com/att/ast) and significant work
has been done on sbrkmem() which gets raw memory, to make it run in various
operating systems.  #ifdef cray is gone, ha, ha.  It appears it can invoke
mmap() or even the standard malloc() as a last resort.  

Porting this to graphviz would require making sure that it doesn't break 
the current windows build on Appveyor with whatever set of defines and
build-time configuration tests that we rely on.

This is puzzling, as it is perfectly legal to have _DLL undefined in the preprocessor directive. Also, I could not reproduce the result. Any chance you could post the output of running make -V on sfio?

contain the software (it is just 4 megs so something probably went wrong).
Actually I’m surprised because I thought we just put all the build artifacts in
a zip file and it would be up to the, er, consumer to figure out what to do with it.

Someone would need to look into this further but it appears a lot of the work
was already done.

559976678,"DiscussionNote","I would actually do a bit more complex variant of this (and is what I meant with regards to ceremony about declarations).  On Linux, you can take advantage of this to use protected visibility, which disables symbol interpositioning which is enabled by default.  This avoids a small penalty by avoiding the PLT for the local symbols (though it may be problematic if you are relying on COPY relocations or if you are relying on certain behaviours with certain TLS models).  Additionally, the snippet that you have does not account for static libraries on Windows, which actually is a problem (you will encounter either warning 4216 or 4217 from link due to the incorrect use of DLL storage for a non-DLL object set).

The check for Linux is because Linux is the only OS that I know that has taken advantage of the protected visibility from ELF.  The BSDs do not support it.

having to choose a C++ subset(?).

How much of the code is in C++ already? A tiny bit was my understanding.

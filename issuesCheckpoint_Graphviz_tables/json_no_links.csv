It seems that sfio seems to be inherently Unix-based .. but I may be mistaken, please advise. I tried following http://www.graphviz.org/doc/winbuild.html but it seems to be more confusing than helpful as all the extra switches should not be necessary with properly configured pkg-config and cross-compilation environment. I believe my environment is proper.

but if I try to have the two nested tables top aligned, i.e. with

``` html

    node [label=""\N"",shape=none];
    pack [label=<

<table color=""red"">

I get this unexpected result (the table on the left somehow gets off the outermost table, the small squared cell disappears):

what I am trying to do: the innermost tables represent some records I have. They can be of an arbitrary number of rows, so I want to pack them into the outer table to keep them somehow together. I want them all to be part of the same node, and all top aligned.
I produce this programmatically, so fitting tables into tables is simpler than managing the layout of a single, top-level table.

```

You can see in the first version the `viewBox` is no longer related to the `width` and `height` attributes. The result is that, for this particular graph, the image appears blank (presumably because there is nothing in that particular rectangle). If you manually adjust the output to be similar to the second version, the image appears fine.

Sometimes when adding an edge it doesn't do this though.  When syntax errors are present in the graph file, it won't re-read the contents after they have been corrected.

I'd be really grateful for a brief overview of how the Graphviz distribution for Windows actually gets built*. 

The Visual Studio project files in this repo are incomplete (lacking for example rules to run Bison/Flex) but most importantly there is no project to build libltdl, which seems to be a fundamental requirement for loading the various layout and rendering engines. I tried assembling a VS project on the basis of the makefile rules but this does not seem to cover all options.

Any help welcomed. It would be great to be able to build and debug the suite in Visual Studio and I'd be more than happy to put in the work to get a complete VS solution.

Thanks.

Currently dot file do not have these [svg attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/script.html):
- onload
- onfocusin
- onfocusout
- onactivate
- onclick
- onmousedown
- onmouseup
- onmouseover
- onmousemove
- onmouseout
- onunload
- onabort
- onerror
- onresize
- onscroll
- onzoom
- onbegin
- onend
- onrepeat

Graphviz by allowing these attributes inside dot file will improve usage possibility when a SVG file is generated. Use them only when output format svg could to be a good solution. It has only to do copy / paste .

I am not a graphviz dev, but It seem that adding these attributes into obj_state_s in [gvcjob.h](https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/master/lib/gvc/gvcjob.h#L190) the job is almost done.

Could you to add this minor feature ?

Currently as workaround is possible to do some xml injection:
example

``` dot
digraph G {
    node [rx=5 ry=5];
    edge [color=""black"", minlen=""1.3"", arrowsize=""0.6"", style=""tapered""];
    A;
    C;

    A -> B -> C;
    B -> D ;
    D -> E;
    C -> E;
    A -> D;

The `virtual_node` allocation in _fastgr.c:240_ leaks when dot lays out clusters, according to the Leaks instrument on Mac developer tools.

Near as I can figure, in `dot_mincross`, the virtual node is allocated in `init_mincross` _mincross.c:337_, then in `merge2` _mincross.c:344_, the virtual node is dropped without deallocation.

Here's the stack trace for the allocation according to Leaks:

```
malloc_zone_malloc
malloc
gmalloc
zmalloc
virtual_node
build_skeleton
class2
dot_mincross
dotLayout
dot_layout
gvLayoutJobs
gvLayout
```

Here's the stack trace for dropping that I constructed by tracing in a debugger:

```
mincross.c:945
merge_components (mincross.c:957)
merge2 (mincross.c:344)
dot_mincross
```

In particular, _mincross.c_ line 945 sets `GD_nlist(g)` to some value, which overwrites the previously allocated virtual node without deallocating it. It doesn't look like the virtual node is saved anywhere else, hence the memory leak.

I'm not familiar enough with the subtleties of dot layout to fix this on my own. I would suggest inserting a virtual node cleanup at _mincross.c:343_ if the virtual nodes are indeed not required past that point.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2015-12-12 00:00:34-05","2021-05-29 00:09:13.026-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

I'm currently relying heavily on dot for laying out a subway-map styled graph. xlabels are perfect for this job, as I can use point-style nodes and keep labels close without messing with the layout.

However, the always-horizontal xlabels are making metro-map styled graphs hard to read, as the nodes are preferably close together. For this use case, it would be sufficient to only consider eight label placements and rotations: left/right horizontally, up/down vertically and the diagonal positions and rotations.

The Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework project (https://www.eclipse.org/gef/), which I lead, aims at providing a complete Eclipse-based DOT authoring environment (in terms of its GEF4 DOT component: https://wiki.eclipse.org/GEF/GEF4/DOT), We are currently building that up, including an Xtext-based DOT editor, as well as a JavaFX-based DOT graph viewer. As part of this, we rely on the native dot executable for SVG image export and layout computation (while parsing, serializing, rendering, etc. is performed by GEF4 DOT) and currently point to an external Graphviz installation (via a preference) for this purpose. 

In order to provide a nice user experience, as Graphviz is provided unter the terms of the EPL, we would like to bundle a minimal (static) dot executable for mac, linux, and windows already as part of our GEF4 DOT component, so users would no longer have to install it separately. I raised a respective contribution questionnaire (CQ) at the Eclipse Foundation, which is currently being processed, including a detailed check by the Eclipse IP team.

As part of the IP screening process, I had to provide the sources from which the respective dot binaries, we would like to bundle, are actually built. The IP team checks them with respect to non EPL-compliant content. As we only want to bundle a very minimal dot executable, I patched the configure and make scripts to remove any unused plugins or UI components: [graphviz-minimal.patch.txt]. From this, I was able to produce a minimal (static) dot executable as follows:

1) ./autogen.sh NOCONFIG

2) ./configure --without-x --without-expat --without-devil --without-webp
--without-poppler --without-rsvg --without-ghostscript --without-visio
--without-pangocairo --without-lasi --without-glitz --without-freetype2
--without-fontconfig --without-gdk --without-gdk-pixbuf --without-gtk
--without-gtkgl --without-gtkglext --without-gts --without-ann --without-glade
--without-ming --without-qt --without-quartz --without-gdiplus --without-libgd
--without-glut --without-ipsepcola --without-digcola --enable-static
--disable-ltdl --disable-shared --disable-tcl

3) make

I passed all the files required by this build configuration to the Eclipse ip team (so far I only built for mac and linux, not windows). As part of their initial triage, the Eclipse IP team came across http://www.graphviz.org/mantisbt/view.php?id=1567&history=1#history, which points out some licensing issues in certain lib files (I did not exclude so far). While the quarz plugin mentioned there is definitely not relevant to us (we excluded it from the configuration), the other issues seem to be problematic, especially regex_win32 (which is LPGL). 

As I personally cannot really assess that, could you provide some information about whether those parts that there mentioned as problematic are indeed mandatory for a minimal static dot executable (as the one we would like to bundle)? Do you see a chance we could provide a minimal dot executable without relying on these files (especially regex_win32 on windows)? Your help would be highly appreciated.

Original ID: 2599
Reported By: bo.at.graphviz

SEVERITY: NORMAL
Submitted: 2016-05-18 08:25:16
## DESCRIPTION

`fdp` can produce very stretched layout for pinned nodes in clusters (subgraphs). Removing `pin=true` (or changing to `pin=false`) makes the issue disappear. Removing edges outside clusters makes the issue disappear. The stretching seems to be exponential in K (spring length).
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Create a simple-clusters.dot file with the following content:

```
graph clusters {
  graph [K=4];

  subgraph cluster_a {
    a [pos=""0,0"", pin=true];
    a1 [pos=""0,1"", pin=true];
  }

  subgraph cluster_b {
    b [pos=""0,0"", pin=true];
    b1 [pos=""0,1"", pin=true];
  }

  a -- b;
  c -- a;
}
```
1. Run the following command

`dot -Kfdp -Tsvg simple-clusters.dot -o/tmp/simple-clusters.svg`
1. See the resulting simple-clusters.svg file and observe how large cluster_a has become (over 3000 pixels).
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

If you remove `pin=true`, the result is much more sensible, but nodes within clusters are moved. If you remove edge `c--a`; the layout is quite compact. Setting `K=1` reduces the blowup for `cluster_a`. For `K=1` the height of `cluster_a` is 293 pixels, for `K=2` it is 677. For `K=3` it is 2510, etc.

What is odd is I can remove different parts and it will pass, but there is no pattern I can discern. 
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Run my dot with dot -Tcanon or whatever. 

One way to avoid the error is to comment out line 10 and 68, both of which merely define edges. Another way is to comment out line 85 which defines a cross-cluster rank. Removing a bunch of sub-clusters which aren't associated with any edges also seems to work for whatever reason. 

I know of no work-around and as such I really need a solution to this problem!

## DESCRIPTION

This was found using 2.28.  If I create a splines=""ortho"" plot using HTML labels with edges in the graph connected to PORTs in the HTML, the edges don't seem to connect to the ports.  Sometimes the edges connect in the middle of the rendered table instead of at the port.

If instead of using splines=""ortho"" you use splines=""polyline"" or splines=""splines"" then the ports are respected.  

also, with splines=""ortho"" the arrows seem to be backwards.  In the plot below I am using arrowtail=crow on some ports and they are drawn the wrong direction when you use splines=""ortho""

Sorry if this bug has already been entered - I couldn't seem to find a similar one in your bug db.

## DESCRIPTION

The file http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/development/SOURCES/graphviz-2.39.20150906.1732.tar.gz has changed since it was initially published.

The original file can be downloaded from http://distfiles.macports.org/graphviz/graphviz-2.39.20150906.1732.tar.gz for comparison.

I'm attaching a text file showing the difference between the two files.

You should probably replace the new version of 2.39.20150906.1732 with the old version from your backups or from the MacPorts server. Otherwise MacPorts users and others who verify the checksums of their downloads will get a checksum verification failure.

This type of problem happened once before, when you originally changed your development snapshots from once-daily to once-daily-if-something-changed but I thought your script had been fixed.

## DESCRIPTION

When having some identical not labelled transitions with ports, dot crashes with a segmentation fault (tried with version 2.36 on Mint 17 and 2.38 on Fedora 21).
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

The following MWE produces a segmentation fault:

```
digraph G {

// c594 [label=<<table title=""algos.common_data_rep.WeaklyConnectedComponent"" port=""p"">
//       <tr><td> WeaklyConnectedComponent </td></tr> </table>>];
// c595 [label=<<table title=""algos.common_data_rep.Actor"" port=""p"">
//       <tr><td> Actor </td></tr> </table>>];
// c604 [label=<<table title=""algos.ars.GraphPartitioning"" port=""p"">
//       <tr><td> GraphPartitioning </td></tr> </table>>];

node [shape=record];
c594 [label=""<p> WeaklyConnectedComponent""];
c595 [label=""<p> Actor""];
c604 [label=""<p> GraphPartitioning""];

c594:p -> c595:p ;
c604:p -> c595:p ; //[label=""tata""];
c604:p -> c595:p ; //[label=""tata""];
c604:p -> c594:p ;

}
```

_(content of test.dot)_

The problem is the same if the ports are declared with <..> syntax or with an HTML node attribute. Adding non empty label to the duplicated transitions corrects the issue.

SEVERITY: CRASH

## DESCRIPTION

```
libpath/.\shortest.c:324: triangulation failed
libpath/.\shortest.c:192: source point not in any triangle
Error: in routesplines, Pshortestpath failed

```

I know there is a similar report #0002382, but I have little tiny graph that produces the crash which might be easier to debug.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

I imagine that whenever rank=same is combined with linking multiple ports that lie in the same rank produces the error.

```
digraph G {
  node [shape=""Mrecord""];

    A -> B -> C
    A -> D

    {rank=""same""; D; C}
    C [ label=""{C-title | <st> Start | <sp> Stop }""];
    D [ label=""{D-title | <b> Begin | <e> End}""];

SEVERITY: IMPORTANT

## DESCRIPTION

Dear all,

Many thanks for producing and maintaining such useful software.

This problem is documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35610736/passing-a-string-to-agedge-in-agraph-py-issue-with-networkx-and-pygraphviz

My issue relates to interactrion with pygraphviz - a python/SWIG wrapper for graphviz.

When this calls the following function, nothing is return resulting in an error:

```
Agedge_t *agedge(Agraph_t * g, Agnode_t * t, Agnode_t * h, char *name,
int cflag)
```

I'm really not convinced that this is an issue with graphviz itself, but I've raised this here just in case it is.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

In python console with Graphviz2.38, networkx 1.11 and pygraphviz installed from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygraphviz:

```
import networkx as nx
G=nx.MultiGraph()
fromnodes=[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5,5,5,7,8,9,10]
tonodes=[1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]
dupedgeind=0
for x,y in zip(fromnodes,tonodes):
    if G.has_edge(x,y):
        dupedgeind=dupedgeind+1
        G.add_edge(x,y,key=dupedgeind)
    else:
        dupedgeind=0
        G.add_edge(x,y,key=dupedgeind)

pos=nx.nx_agraph.pygraphviz_layout(G,prog='sfdp')
```

Produces the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_agraph.py"", line 262, in pygraphviz_layout
    A=to_agraph(G)
  File ""C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\networkx\drawing\nx_agraph.py"", line 155, in to_agraph
    A.add_edge(u,v,key=str(key),**str_edgedata)
  File ""C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\pygraphviz\agraph.py"", line 484, in add_edge
    eh = gv.agedge(self.handle, uh, vh, key, _Action.find)
KeyError: 'agedge: no key'
```
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

This problem is documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35610736/passing-a-string-to-agedge-in-agraph-py-issue-with-networkx-and-pygraphviz

I think the source of the error is within this pygraphviz file, graphviz_wrap.c, line 3921:

https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/blob/245fc9507a9e40f8c35762dd5073e42edb0388d3/pygraphviz/graphviz_wrap.c

I've also raised reports on the networkx and pygraphviz source repositories:

## DESCRIPTION

I have programmatically generated the attached large .dot file.

I compile it under Linux with

dot -Tps mygraphmatched.dot -o mygraphmatched.ps

However, the last declared node gets duplicated multiple times in the resulting graph (white circles in the linked .ps image, with label ""res_582"").
(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8286935/mygraphmatched.ps)

I have tried dot, sfdp, fdp, twopi.

I suspect a bug in the dot compiler, but a second opinion wouldn't hurt.

Thanks in advance!

P.S. I removed all the individual node descriptions regarding label and then merged node declarations into the resulting 5 different node type groups (regarding shape and fillcolor). This resolved the issue of duplicate nodes appearing, but I lose the individual label functionality, which was useful to me.

## DESCRIPTION

> Mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart descriptions and produces images as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a way of representing entities and interactions over some time period. This program and the language it parses have been inspired by Graphviz Dot, which provides a really good way to document State Transition Diagrams, data structures and directed graphs.
> http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/index.html
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Input any msc source, for example

```
# MSC for some fictional process
msc {
  hscale = ""2"";

  a,b,c;

  a->b [ label = ""ab()"" ] ;
  b->c [ label = ""bc(TRUE)""];
  c=>c [ label = ""process(1)"" ];
  c=>c [ label = ""process(2)"" ];
  ...;
  c=>c [ label = ""process(n)"" ];
  c=>c [ label = ""process(END)"" ];
  a<<=c [ label = ""callback()""];
  ---  [ label = ""If more to run"", ID=""*"" ];
  a->a [ label = ""next()""];
  a->c [ label = ""ac1()\nac2()""];
  b<-c [ label = ""cb(TRUE)""];
  b->b [ label = ""stalled(...)""];
  a<-b [ label = ""ab() = FALSE""];
}
```

You should get the image like http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/img/example0.png.

## DESCRIPTION

I use graphviz for a long time. Recently, I made an update to the development snapshot (graphviz-2.39.20150720.1238) to use newer features but from there on, multiple edges between nodes are displayed as a single edge (see test_graphviz-2.39.20150720.1238.pdf).
For graphviz-2.36 (and before) the edges were well separated (see test_graphviz-2.36.0.pdf).

I tried to adjust the ""concentrate"" attribute (which sounds to me to have a similar effect).
Also changing the ""sep"" and ""esep"" attributed didn't work.
I also built from source without any difference to the provided pkg. 

Any idea what is going wrong? Any other attribute which has a different default value now?
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

a -> b
a -> b
}

A graph that takes a few seconds with default splines takes >10 minutes with ortho edges. I ran VTune on the code and found that vast majority of the time was spent in this function:

```
void
PQcheck (void)
{
  int i;
  for (i = 1; i <= PQcnt; i++) {
    if (N_IDX(pq[i]) != i) {
      assert (0);
    }
  }
}
```

When I made the function empty, the rendering became fast again.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Run ""dot -Tpng system.dot -O"" on build 2.38.0. This will take about 10 minutes on a very fast desktop machine.

## DESCRIPTION

PIC output produces odd error messages when fed to gpic due to roff comments being embedded in the PIC code, instead of PIC comments.  While possibly legal, gpic can't handle these comments.
More importantly, after fixing the comment format, it became apparent that the PIC renderer produces useless output (a string of numbers representing x/y coordinates - nothing else) for all PIC commands, except for the ellipse command.

Icing on the cake is that (to my knowledge) PIC can only ""fill"" circles, ellipses, and boxes, not general polygons.  

Maybe it is time to bury PIC - or just support a subset of object types.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

run any dot file thru the PIC renderer and the output through gpic.

Submitted: 2014-03-30 15:58:37
## DESCRIPTION

Below program will consume more and more memory until the system runs out.
At the very least the GVC_t::apis linked lists need to be freed.
The leak is on my system about 10 kB per iteration, but I guess that depends on the number of plugins installed.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Compile and run this code and you should see its memory usage grow unlimited, at least if you have any plugins.

```
#include <graphviz/gvc.h>

int main()
{
  while (1)
    gvFreeContext(gvContext());
  return 0;

If setting the edge direction to ""both"" and defining an arrowhead and an arrowtail different from ""none"" (see reproduction steps), these ends get mixed up (so, which is the head and which is the tail part of the edge) if splines=ortho is also defined.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Case 1 (without splines=ortho) - edge ends as expected

```
digraph Test {
    nodesep = 1.0;
    ranksep = 1.0;
    edge [dir = both, arrowhead = dot, arrowtail = curve, headlabel=""Head"", taillabel=""Tail""];  
    A -> B;
    A -> C;
    D -> C; 
}
```

Case 2 (with splines=ortho set) - edge ends between A->B and D->C inverted 

```
digraph Test {
    splines = ortho;
    nodesep = 1.0;
    ranksep = 1.0;
    edge [dir = both, arrowhead = dot, arrowtail = curve, headlabel=""Head"", taillabel=""Tail""];  
    A -> B;
    A -> C;
    D -> C;
}
```
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Furthermore, if adding for example E -> C edge it will be displayed correctly (only A->B and D->C is wrong). If adding another F -> C edge, all edges with target node C are correct, but not A->B. 

It somehow relates to the number of edges that have the target node C.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:00:22-04","2023-04-02 00:01:10.453-04","[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"

Hi!I'm using Graphviz as a library in my win32 program.My issue is when drawing few graphs(less than 1000), it works well.But when the number of graph grows to tens of thousands, the physical memory is used up.My program's  execution flow is:
①gvContext()
②Loop：agopen(graphid, Agdirected, 0) -> insert nodes and edges -> gvLayout(gvc, graph, ""dot"") -> gvRenderFilename(gvc, graph, ""svg"", filename) -> gvFreeLayout(gvc, graph) -> agclose(graph))
③gvFreeContext(gvc)

Did I make some mistakes?I find that when calling gvLayout, memory usage grows about 10 MB.But it doesn't reduce after calling gvFreeLayout.So,after having drew thousands of graphs, memory usage grows to 2GB, then the program crashes.

Circo, as described in the dot manual, produces ""Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle's perimeter as possible."" This does not happen with my version of circo. In many simple cases I get the least optimized or close to the least optimized case. I've uploaded an example. This simple layout could be optimized by placing 3 edges on the outer perimeter and one in the center, but instead it places 3 in the center and one on the perimeter.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Create a digraph with 5 nodes or more and a circo layout.
Connect nodes 3 spaces away (2 nodes inbetween).
Render the graph.

This isn't appropriate on systems where libc++ is the default, including OS X 10.9 and later. In fact the user may wish to switch the C++ library from its default by adding ""-stdlib=libc++"" or ""-stdlib=libstdc++"" to CXXFLAGS. This should be supported. Probably Graphviz should not be specifying which C++ library to use and should instead leave it up to the compiler's default or the user-supplied CXXFLAGS.

In MacPorts, we simply replace ""-lstdc++"" with ""-lstdc++"" when appropriate, based on MacPorts' determination, but of course that's not the proper solution:

PLATFORM: MAC
## DESCRIPTION

First, I am using graphviz C library, in version 2.36 (installed using the .pkg downloaded form the website).
So I am working on the evolution of a graph and thus, I plot several observations of the same graph (with different edges, length of edges, but same nodes).
I want to plot them in a large page (same size for all), so that the distances are preserved and comparable. So I wanted to set the ""page"" attribute to a very large value (to make sure all graphs would fit on it), but this setting is not accounted for in the pdf generated.
For instance, I use:
agsafeset(g, ""page"", ""8000,5000!"", """");

which should create a very large file, but even with a simple small graph (see uploaded file), the graph fills the space.
It worked fine with the 2.30 version I had before...

As for the ""pos"" attribute, I set the first node (nodes[0]) at ""0,0"", even tried with ""0,0!"", but this node is never in the middle of the graph...
Here is the simple C code I tried it with:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <cgraph.h>
#include <cdt.h>
#include <gvc.h>

int main()
{
    Agraph_t *g;
    Agnode_t *nodes[5];
    Agedge_t *e[4];
    GVC_t* gvc = gvContext();

    g = agopen(""Graphe"", Agstrictundirected, NULL);

    agsafeset(g, ""page"", ""32,20!"", """");
    agsafeset(g, ""center"", ""true"", """");

    int j;
    char nomNoeud[10];

    for (j = 0; j < 5; j++)
    {
        sprintf(nomNoeud,""Node %d"", j+1);
        nodes[j] = agnode(g, nomNoeud, TRUE);
    }

    agsafeset(nodes[0], ""root"", ""true"", """");
    agsafeset(nodes[0], ""pin"", ""true"", """");
    agsafeset(nodes[0], ""pos"", ""0,0!"", """");

    e[0] = agedge(g, nodes[0], nodes[1], 0, 1);
    agsafeset(e[0], ""len"", ""5"", """");
    e[1] = agedge(g, nodes[0], nodes[2], 0, 1);
    agsafeset(e[1], ""len"", ""3"", """");
    e[2] = agedge(g, nodes[3], nodes[1], 0, 1);
    agsafeset(e[2], ""len"", ""1"", """");
    e[3] = agedge(g, nodes[4], nodes[1], 0, 1);
    agsafeset(e[3], ""len"", ""10"", """");
    gvLayout (gvc, g, ""neato"");
    char FileName[30];
    sprintf(FileName, ""Test.pdf"");
    gvRenderFilename (gvc, g, ""pdf"", FileName);
    //agwrite(g, stdout);
    gvFreeLayout(gvc, g);
    agclose(g);
}
```

Which results in this graph:

```
strict graph Graphe {
         graph [center=true,
                 page=""32,20""
         ];
         node [label=""\N""];
         ""Node 1""         [pin=true,
                 pos=""0,0!"",
                 root=true];
         ""Node 1"" -- ""Node 2""     [len=5];
         ""Node 1"" -- ""Node 3""     [len=3];
         ""Node 4"" -- ""Node 2""     [len=1];
         ""Node 5"" -- ""Node 2""     [len=10];
 }

```

I tried with a .ps output as advised by erg on the forum, but I cannot open the file with Mac's Preview or Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator...

Dot generates PDF's that are missing all labels and edges, and just shows the nodes, if the nodes are filled with a gradient.

The same graph works fine with PNG output format, or if a constant color is used instead of a gradient.

Create a simple test.dot:

```

```
    dot -Tpng -otest.png test.dot

Open the test.png file and see the expected labels and edge.

## DESCRIPTION

If a font description does not match style, it is not found. It works for 2.26.3, but that version does not support `<B>something</B>` HTML-style. 

```
Versions 2.28.0, 2.30.1, and 2.38 report
(dot.exe:6008): Pango-WARNING **: couldn't load font ""Trlit_CG Times Not-Rotated 14"", falling back to ""Sans Not-Rotated 14"", expect ugly output.

```

This can be solved if the font specification matches the actual font including its style. I was really confused by the error message, the working version 2.26.3, and not working others.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

An example generating the error:

```
digraph MyGraph {
  ""off_241"" [label=< 
<FONT FACE=""Trlit_CG Times"">2nty-kAw-1r</FONT><BR/>id:<B>10</B>

}
```

A modification getting through without any error report:

```
digraph MyGraph {
  ""off_241"" [label=< 
<FONT FACE=""Trlit_CG Times Italic"">2nty-kAw-1r</FONT><BR/>id:<B>10</B>

         <http://www.perl.org/>

```

For the complete log see https://trac.macports.org/ticket/46582

This is odd because the graphviz source code doesn't seem to mention a specific version of automake.

The libtool 2.4.4 source distribution includes a file aclocal.m4 which was itself built with aclocal from automake 1.14.1. This file gets installed at /opt/local/share/libtool/aclocal.m4. It contains lines like this:

```
# AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION(VERSION)
# ----------------------------
# Automake X.Y traces this macro to ensure aclocal.m4 has been
# generated from the m4 files accompanying Automake X.Y.
# (This private macro should not be called outside this file.)

])

# -----------------------------
# aclocal traces this macro to find the Autoconf version.
# This is a private macro too.  Using m4_define simplifies
# the logic in aclocal, which can simply ignore this definition.
m4_define([_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION], [])

# AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION
# -------------------------------
# Call AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION and AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION so they can be traced.
# This function is AC_REQUIREd by AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.
AC_DEFUN([AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION],

m4_ifndef([AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION],
  [m4_copy([m4_PACKAGE_VERSION], [AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION])])dnl
_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION(m4_defn([AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION]))])

```

Upgrading to libtool 2.4.5, released 2015-01-19, fixes the problem, and I've requested this here: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/46635

libtool 2.4.5's aclocal.m4 was built with aclocal from automake 1.15 and contains these lines:
# AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION(VERSION)
# ----------------------------
# Automake X.Y traces this macro to ensure aclocal.m4 has been
# generated from the m4 files accompanying Automake X.Y.
# (This private macro should not be called outside this file.)

])
# _AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION(VERSION)
# -----------------------------
# aclocal traces this macro to find the Autoconf version.
# This is a private macro too.  Using m4_define simplifies
# the logic in aclocal, which can simply ignore this definition.

m4_define([_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION], [])
# AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION
# -------------------------------
# Call AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION and AM_AUTOMAKE_VERSION so they can be traced.
# This function is AC_REQUIREd by AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.

AC_DEFUN([AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION],

m4_ifndef([AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION],
  [m4_copy([m4_PACKAGE_VERSION], [AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION])])dnl
_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION(m4_defn([AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION]))])

The graphviz source includes two copies of aclocal.m4—one in the root directory, which was built with aclocal from automake 1.13.4, and one in the libltdl directory which was built with aclocal from automake 1.11.1.

## DESCRIPTION

In our Eclipse tool (KIELER: http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/confluence/display/KIELER/Home) we have a process open that talks using stdin/stdout with dot.exe in order to do (hierarchical) layouts for state charts diagrams.

When performing multiple layouts, sporadically single ones are corrupt in the sense that some edges start NOT at node borders (but within the node).

We can reproduce this in our tool. The situation SEEMS to be better, if we have a new Java process for talking to dot.exe for EACH layout invocation. 1. This REALLY slows down layout, 2. we are not confident that this workaround really SOLVES the problem, because we not fully understand the problem.

We tried one quite simple example in a GraphViz web service: http://graphviz-dev.appspot.com/

The example is as follows:

```
digraph {
    graph [aspect=""1.22,1"",
        bb=""0,138,125.5,0"",
        nodesep=0.6041667,
        rankdir=TB,
        ranksep=0.6041667,
        splines=spline
    ];
    node [fixedsize=true,
        label=""\N"",
        shape=box
    ];
    edge [dir=none];
    node1    [height=0.47222,
        width=0.63889];
    node2    [height=0.55556,
        width=0.70833];
    node1 -> node2   [comment=edge1,
        fontname=Arial,
        fontsize=18,
        label="" A / O = true"",
        lp=""75.5,66""];           
}
```

When doing multiple consecutive layouts (can be triggered simply by adding space characters to ""modify"" the dot file), eventually there are corrupt layouts, just like the corrupt layouts we get in our Eclipse tool. We PRESUME that the online web service is programmed also with just ONE open process talking to dot.exe like our setup - but this is just an hypothesis.

In the attached zip you find these screen shots and also the dot test file.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Reproduce:
1. go to the web service: http://graphviz-dev.appspot.com/
2. enter the dot file (from attachment or description)
3. make fake-changes to it by adding space characters and carefully inspect the output image
4. eventually you should be able to see corrupt graph layouts",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:09:05-04","2022-06-17 00:05:51.001-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

GraphViz currently has no pre-processor for imports. See: http://www.malloc47.com/preprocessors-and-graphviz/

It would be great if such a feature existed so that styles, for example, could be externalized and reused.

2. Create a common style for both graphs.
3. Change the style for both graphs by editing only one file.

I built using ./configure --prefix=/tmp/test && make install and using this version it also crashes.

Lastly I attempted to build and test using the latest graphviz from git://github.com/ellson/graphviz.git and it worked! by bisecting between commit f54ac2c (crashed) and 57337e4 (worked) I found that the commit below may have fixed the problem or at least made it less likely to occur.

I want to move an arrowhead back along the edge a bit, so I tried preceding it with 'none'.

Specifically I want an arrow tail ""nonenonenonetee"" like I could cut the graph below the edge. It didn't work.

I get a gap in the edge and no head after the first 'none'.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Create a file  strike_edge.dot with contents :

```
digraph G {

## DESCRIPTION

I'm trying to export a dot graph to an output that supports links.

When using a font with spaces in its name (e.g. ""PT Sans""), `ps` and `ps2` output renderers generate faulty postscript. The postscript fails to load in evince 
(crashes), shows an empty document (okular) and returns an error with ps2pdf.

Excerpt from the generate postscript:

14 /PT Sans set_font

Presumably the space between ""PT"" and ""Sans"" has to be escaped somehow.

The `ps:cairo` renderer includes the font with its real name:

/FontName /PTSans-Regular def

... so that renderer works fine, but I would like to include the URLs from the dot file, and I think only the `ps2` renderer supports link export at this moment.

I tried to escape the spaces in the postscript output with backslash or quotes, but that's apparently not valid postscript either and I'm not crazy enough to read the full postscript specification.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

To reproduce,

1) change the font:

```
graph [fontname = ""PT Sans""];
node [fontname = ""PT Sans""];
edge [fontname = ""PT Sans""];
```

2) export to `ps` or `ps2`.

## DESCRIPTION

I have need of a lefty interface that is not unlike the code described as Appendix B.1 ""Finite Automaton Simulator"" in the (admittedly aged) DOTTY users guide entitled ""Editing graphs with dotty"". But after coding the example (w/some
minor tweaks to fit my data) and running it, the graph is produced, as expected,
into an X11/Xlib/XAW3d window using a default visual of 24-bit TrueColor.

According to the lefty code, the first graph node SHOULD be ""filled"" in ""tan"" with BlackPixel foreground and WhitePixel background. Pressing the select-mouse-button should modify this display to its next state position having the 2nd node in ""tan"" and the first node now in ""lite-grey"". Pressing the middle-mouse button should reverse this state transition, back to the original picture.

Instead, NO VISUAL FEEDBACK occurs at all. The picture remains constant with all nodes displayed in black-outline on white, non-filled, with ZERO changes as mouse interactions occur.

However, changes ARE observed in the lefty text window making table changes and
accurately depicting the changes in color and fill-state for individual nodes.

I rebuilt lefty (I am a retired Bell Labs programmer) stripping the code down
to the bare minimum (X11/XAW3D support only) to eliminate things like CAIRO, pango, libpng, et. al. to limit the list of things to examine. However, attempts at debugging on my own with virtually ZERO internal guidance has not been fruitful. My built version behaves EXACTLY as the original.

Thus I am stuck. Either, the problem is outside of lefty - (KDE Desktop, Xorg Server); or perhaps it is fixed in a newer version - but I could find no information in changelogs and/or bug reports that even comes close to describing anything about lost/missing/misapplied graph attributes. As a vague test of the external mechanisms, I modified the example code to re-activate the menu item that writes the current graph into a DOT-file. Subsequent use of DOTTY on this file CORRECTLY displays the proper filled/colored nodes as they should have been when written from the incorrectly-displayed example state.

This leads me to believe the error is truly within lefty/dotty and that despite
making the graph/lefty changes to its datastructure, SOMETHING neglects to interpret those changes and push them far enough through the software layers to reach AND successfully modify the X11 primitives as it does when initially reading the DOT description.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Extract the script file ""fa.lefty"" and the two data files ""nfaexp.dot"" and ""nfaexp.trans"" from the attached tar.gz and place them into a convenient current working directory.
Then invoke with the command ""lefty fa.lefty"" and observe the created X11 window.

## DESCRIPTION

Bonjour,
J’essaye d’installer et de faire fonctionner l’Extension :GraphViz sur un mediawiki pour générer des graphes. Puis par la suite installer les extensions xycategoriesBrowser ou FormGraph pour les générer automatiquement.

Mediawiki : 1.23.1   PHP : 5.5.11 sur Windows7
Extension :Graphviz  v1.3.1 qui date du 2014-07-10 (très récent) http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz 
Le programme Graphviz 2.38 installé depuis http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php   en .msi

 Voila mon problème les graphes ne veulent pas se générer avec les balises par exemple :

```
<graphviz border='frame' format='png' caption='Graph for example no. 1'>
digraph example1 {Hello->World}
</graphviz>

```

Le problème s’emblerait venir de la commande de wfshell_exec : 

```
protected static function executeCommand( $command, &$output ) {
        if ( !wfIsWindows() ) {
// redirect stderr to stdout so that it will be included in outputArray
            $command .= "" 2>&1"";        
                }
    $output = wfShellExec( $command, $ret );
            if ( $ret != 0 ) {  
return false;       }
        return true;
}
```

La source et le fichier .png sont bien créé quand je met des exit donc la $command est bonne. Le $ret me met toujours un false car égal à 1 et la sortie $output est nulle. Je suppose que c’est la fonction de shell_exec qui bug.

Evidement j’ai bien les droits utilisateurs dans les dossiers, la variable d’environnement path modifiée, les chemins dot et exec path, l’Extension ImageMaps qui fonctionne.

Cette function executeCommand intervient ici :

            {
                self::deleteFiles( $graphParms, $isPreview, false );
                return self::errorHTML( $errorText );
            }

            // execute the map creation command
            if ( !self::executeCommand( $graphParms->getMapCommand( $isPreview ), $errorText ) )
            {
                self::deleteFiles( $graphParms, $isPreview, false );

// remove path info from the errorText (file base names are allowed to pass)
        $errorText = str_replace( $imageDir, """", $errorText );
        $errorText = str_replace( $sourceAndMapDir, """", $errorText );
        return self::multilineErrorHTML( $errorText );
            }
```

Donc quelqu'un aurait une idée pour faire fonctionner correctement la fonction de shell_exec ?
Merci beaucoup de votre attention et de l'intérêt que vous pourrez porter à mon problème.

## DESCRIPTION

I've detected a strange behavior on Graphviz when trying to layout horizontal workflows.

The graph i'm trying to layout is nothing more than a directed graph with nodes representing tasks and edges representing the flow, with the graph pointing towards a direction (left to right, in my case).

The issue is when there is a reflux, in other words, an edge pointing back to a node that has already been represented. In this case, the edge ALWAYS chooses the upward direction, when there is a more obvious best path if it chooses downwards (no crossover with other paths).

The picture attached to this ticket explains more clearly this behavior.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

## DESCRIPTION

When building the python bindings against e.g. python 2.7, -lpython2.7 is added to the linker command line but the linker's default search path is not modified. When users try to build against Homebrew's python, Homebrew's libpython2.7 is not in the default linker search path so it is not found and the module is linked against the system python framework instead, which causes a segfault on ""import gv"" from the Homebrew python.

This can be resolved a few different ways, probably in ascending order of correctness:
1. add -L$PYTHON_PREFIX/lib to the linker path
2. discover python build flags with e.g. python2.7-config --ldflags
3. link modules with -undefined dynamic_lookup so that Python symbols are resolved at import time and not at link time, which has the pleasant effect that modules built for one interpreter can be used with another without segfaults

I've provided a patch for option 1.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Install Python from python.org, Homebrew, Enthought, or some other vendor so that ""python"" invokes the new non-system python interpreter.
2. Install graphviz from source.
3. Run python -c ""import gv"" and observe that the interpreter segfaults.

On the mailing list (with the same Subject/Summary - 2014-08-30) John Ellson and I have tried to craft a DOT file which seamlessly joins 2 edge heads and 1 edge tail at a single point with (a) no visible node (b) no gaps between the heads and the tail. We cannot achieve this.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

The attached file x.gv contains 4 separate gv files showing the interaction between style = 'invis' present/absent and samehead = 1 present/absent.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

To my eye the 3rd of the 4 images generated from x.gv is the most pleasing, but for some reason there is still a visible node, despite using:
`""one"" [ fixedsize=""1"" height=""0"" label="""" width=""0"" ]`

Using fixedsize='shape' makes no difference.

In the 4th of the 4, using:
""one"" [ fixedsize=""1"" height=""0"" label="""" style=""invis"" width=""0"" ]
this node is invisible, but still takes up space, so the tail leaving it does not connect to the 2 incoming heads.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:09:13-04","2022-07-09 00:06:44.935-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

i wanted to view my ontology graph under the owl viz tab in protoge but it needed me to install graphviz which i did. after installing graphviz and changing its directory, the characters of my root class where formatted to look like rectangles. furthermore where ever i type i see the same rectangles instead of text and additionally cant submit a query or proceed with my analysis. i tried reinstallling protoge, java and windows itself. but the problem still exists. it can only be solved by opening a new user account but then again i would have to install graphviz and we are back to square one.

## DESCRIPTION

I'm developing a mips to x86-64 binary translator (dynamic recompiler) and to track the bugs in my recompiler, I added some stuff to output a .gv file which describes a CFG with disassembly for both MIPS and x86-64 code.

The first file is ""cfg_sb_0xA3FB0720.gv"". It is a entry function to start a mips superblock, not the real stuff. I can open it and have a graph. But sometimes if I close it then reopen it, Gvedit may crash.

I attached the .png file for the first file so you can have a general idea of what I'm trying to get.

The second file is ""cfg_sb_0xA3FB0800.gv"". I always fail to open it with Gvedit. If I strip a lot of subgraphes inside, I can then open it but it is not very helpful.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

The reason is that there aren't any debug libraries on that machine, so the build directives for the file edgepaint.exe needs to be updated.

## DESCRIPTION

In the settings dialog, the drop-down box to enter the Name of the parameter to modify does not work.  Clicking in the box just turns it black.  This does not happen all the time, but most of the time, and makes the program much less usable.  Also, sometimes pressing the OK button does nothing but close the dialog, no image file of the graph saved.  Sometimes, doing layout with neato, then switching back to dot, will restore the ability to generate the image file.  This may be an interaction between this program and another, but I've not been able to see a pattern.  Strangely, when the cursor is in the Value box, pressing Enter gives a dialog to save the file!

## DESCRIPTION

verrsion: graphviz-2.30.1

Segmentation fault when gvLayout() called after gvFreeLayout()
See minimal example in ""step to reproduce"".

I need to relayout created graph again, so I do:

1) greate graph
2) gvLayout()
3) graph modifications: add/remove nodes or edges
4) gvFreeLayout()
5) gvLayout() <---- SIGSEG
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

1) minimal example:

```
================= gvLayout_SIGSEG.c ======================
#include <graphviz/cgraph.h>
#include <graphviz/gvc.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    GVC_t* gvc = gvContext();

    Agraph_t* g1 = agopen(""g1"", Agundirected, NULL);
    agnode(g1, ""n1"", 1);
    agnode(g1, ""n2"", 1);

    gvFreeLayout(gvc, g1);
    gvLayout(gvc, g1, ""dot"");

    return 0;
}
```
# 

2) compiling:

`gcc -Wall gvLayout_SIGSEG.c -lgvc -lcgraph -lcdt -I/usr/include/graphviz`

3) run

```
$ ./a.out 
Segmentation fault
```

4) call `trace`

```

Causes a warning in the command line tool, causes random crash under OSX in the Graphviz graphical user interface. 

The generated pdf file does not reflect the arrow styles (should be ""dot"" for some of the outgoing edges. Maybe I did something wrong, but in any case, the tool does not report (my) error correcrectly or there is a bug.

```

`graph[splines=curved]` -> passes without crash, but lines are doubled, not OK. (This is definitely an error).
`graph[splines=ortho]` -> passes without crash, but lines do not start and end at correct positions. (This seem just to be a an unimplemented feature, right?)

However, most importantly it should work with the default splines setting (true), this is what I and everybody really need/want. 

If setting the node spacing large enough it passes compilation but start and endpoints of the splines are incorrect, so there is definitely something severely wrong with ""dot"".

## DESCRIPTION

'dot' command fails on one of .dot files with this message:
Warning: <stdin>: syntax error in line 4 near ''

There are 3 problems:
1. It says 'Warning', but it actually stops at this point, produces no output and exits. So it should be an error instead.
2. No column in provided, and line 4 in the input is very long. So line should be provided.
3. 'dot' command exits with an error code 0, which normally indicates success. It should be something like -1.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

We use flex for scanning, which doesn't provide much context, especially for scanning errors. The code now gives a bit more information and some context.

## DESCRIPTION

I am currently using SchemasSpy, the force-metadata-jbdc-driver, and Graphviz to draw ERD diagrams for a series of custom objects in Salesforce.com. When I launch SchemaSpy through the command prompt, the dot.exe application occasionally freezes when trying to draw 1-degree and 2-degree relationship diagrams and output them as PNG files. 

What's interesting is that dot.exe freezes on the same objects every time I run SchemaSpy. Furthermore, I can kill dot.exe within the task manager, and SchemaSpy and Graphviz will continue drawing the remaining diagrams, unless it gets held up on another object, upon which I must kill dot.exe in the task manager once again. 

After SchemaSpy finishes running, any object that caused dot.exe to freeze will not have any diagrams saved.

Killing dot.exe does generate an error message, which I've listed below. Also, regarding the objects that cause dot.exe to free, they are simple in nature and consist of a simple parent/child relationship. There are no self references or anything that I could see causing an infinite loop to crash dot.exe. Finally, these same objects are successfully drawn in the overall summary ERD diagram that draws the relationships between every object in Salesforce, so I'm not sure why the diagrams would fail when focusing on the objects individually.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Launch SchemasSpy from the command prompt: 
`java -cp schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar;force-metadata-jdbc-driver-2.2.jar net.sourceforge.schemaspy.Main -t force -u myusername -p mypassword -font Arial -fontsize 8 -hq -norows -o doc -db na14 -desc ""Extracted from na14 on Force.com""`
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Here is the error message I receive whenever I use the task manager to kill the dot.exe file

VERSION: 2.22, 2.24 AND 2.25
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

when using gvRenderData() to render to a memory location, freeing that memory location results in a heap corruption; If I understand the code correctly gv allocates the memory himself, so the following code should be valid:
<CD>
..
char\* buf = NULL;
unsigned int len = 0;
gvRenderData(gv, g, format, &buf, &length);
..
free(buf);
</CD>
<br>

However, this triggers a heap corruption exception on Windows. Probably somewhere inside the function a buffer overflow occurs.
<br>

Output tested was bmp, png and jpg, possibly more are affected

[arif] That code runs fine on release libs too.
He needs to send us more information.
Since the original code didn't work on visual studio I suspect he uses a
different compiler.

Sorry for the very late reply but there is no status notification when people react to your bug. So I checked the status for a while but nothing happened then just gave up. Back on topic:

I am using MSVC 9.0 compiler, attached you will find a zip file of the whole application including project file. The example also works (the example I posted didn't cause I mistyped 'length' and didn't define 'format') I have tried this code with graphviz 2.25.20090923.0445, 2.24 and 2.22.

There is a heap corruption when free(buf) is executed.

Thank you for submitting the bug report.

We will investigate this further when we can.
We appreciate your providing the information.

Change to extension to something else and try to resend. that might work
And also there is a 10 mb limit i believe.

[amelek]
This bug ( http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/b1775.html ) is probably
caused by incompatibility of heap implementation used by graphviz dll
(in which malloc was called) and program heap (in which free is
called). It's (usually) impossible to free memory allocated by
software compiled in different compiler. See
<CD>
http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=180&thread.id=39190 .
</CD>
Only possible fix I see, is to provide free() method from dll. Adding
something like gvFreeMemory(void*) could probably fix this bug.

[erg]

I suppose this could be the problem, though since we both use MS compilers (but different versions),
one might have hoped for binary compatibility. And if it's really a case of different heaps, that's
just sicko. It's certainly contrary to the spirit of the C library.

There is also the issue that came up earlier, in that the API uses FILE, which can be very different
depending on what compilation system is used.

A workaround is to use the provided project files to build Graphviz from source. This would handle
any compiler incompatibilities, but would not take care of the DLL and main using separate heaps.

## DESCRIPTION

Thank you for your work on these awesome tools!

It would be nice if you could re-enable alt attributes for area tags in cmaps.

As far as I can see, they were removed (set to alt="""") in 2004 because of Internet Explorer's former misuse of alt attributes as tooltips.[1] With IE Version 8 this browser seems to work as expected and uses the title attribute as tooltip.[2]

This change would:
- improve support for people with visual disability
- support users of some text browsers
- make the image contents better indexable by search engines  

A nice addon would be to also enable configuring the alt attribute via HTML-like labels like `<TD alt=""something"">`.

Thanks for considering!

Other graphs using this general approach (only put the cluster nodes explicitly in the subgraph, put all arcs at top level) lay out fine.

Deleting only the last cluster crashes the same way as the original file.
Deleting the final 2 clusters (leaving 5) creates a layout, but produces the message
Warning: Unable to reclaim box space in spline routing for edge ""PARTNER_FOO"" -> ""L1_IN"". Something is probably seriously wrong.

Deleting the final 3 clusters (leaving 4) crashes with a ""reclaim box space"" message; deleting 4 clusters (leaving 3) runs but produces 2 ""reclaim box space"" messages; leaving 2 clusters runs without complaint; leaving 1 cluster crashes with 2 ""reclaim box space"" messages; leaving 0 clusters runs without complaint.

SEVERITY: IMPORTANT

## DESCRIPTION

I am working with large dot files (100-400kb), containing either a single large digraph (200-400 nodes, 300-600 edges) or many (100+) smaller digraphs (3-30 nodes, 2-50 edges).

While using dot or neato to render these graphs, I am encountering a ""Segmentation Fault: 11"" at a randomly selected point during the render (sometimes on the 10th step, sometimes on the 100th, sometimes on the 1000th). The problem occurs whether I am using png:quartz:quartz or png:cairo:cairo, as their code paths coincide in the relevant spot. I have tracked the problem down as follows:

The segfault is caused by an EXC_BAD_ACCESS in libsystem_c.dylib flockfile(). This happens when flockfile is called by fread of fseek (different code path for quartz and cairo) with a null file pointer. That null file pointer is produced when gvusershape_find() is called with an empty string as a parameter (the string should usually be the path/name of the image file), returning a usershape_t with the 'f' field set to zero.

That string should be initialized in shapes.c:2887 as follows:
    name = ND_shape(n)->name;

This is as far down the rabbit hole as I was able to go on my own.

I am attaching a tarball containing three files:
1.png is a randomly chosen small png file from my normal usage
test.dot.lua is a lua script that outputs a large dot file (50 digraphs, 400 nodes and 800 edges each)
test.sh symlinks 1.png to 2.png through 200.png, then runs test.dot.lua and pipes the output to dot
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. ungzip/untar the attached file
2. run test.sh (which requires lua and dot)

## DESCRIPTION

I'm generating a programmatically calling Dot from a .NET app.  The app uses a very small third-party wrapper to generate a graph without explicitly opening a command shell, writing the resultant image files to disk, etc. ... I've also reported the error to the developers of the wrapper here...

https://github.com/JamieDixon/GraphViz-C-Sharp-Wrapper/issues/1

... but I don't think that they're the problem.  The wrapper simply attaches two streams to StdIn and StdOut... sends the dot-formatting string to StdIn, then tries to copy the resultant PNG data back out of the StdOut.  It does this copy with a simple C# call to the Stream.CopyTo(Stream) method.  So far so good...

The problem only seems to occur when we pass in a larger digraph string (in my case, larger than a couple of dozen nodes?).  The call to CopyTo seems to hang forever.  According to MicroSoft, CopyTo will continue to attempt to copy until the stream is closed.  I suspect that for larger graphs, Dot is not closing the stream after it renders the graph to StdOut under Windows.

I read a decade-old forum discussion...

http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.graphviz/1006

... about this being intended functionality since Dot has the ability to render multiple graphs from one dot file, but it seemed to cause problems for the Windows guys at the time...  I'm not sure that this is still the intended functionality.  Also, I'm not sure why this would only be a problem with larger dot-formatting strings.  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!

Hello,

the postscript (ps, ps2) output driver of Dot does not support unicode characters. Please add support at least for en/em-dash which are in standard postscript fonts.

I would also appreciate spaces http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space. 
In Unicode, thin space is encoded at `U+2009`   thin space (HTML:    ).
`Unicode's U+202F  ` narrow no-break space (HTML:  )
is a non-breaking space with a width similar to that of the thin space.

Thank you
HG

Original ID: 2410
Reported By: pklesk

SEVERITY: FEATURE
Submitted: 2014-01-10 13:37:53
## DESCRIPTION

I have tried to apply xlabels on my graphs and position them using xlp. But the xlp attribute seems to have no effect,

and the xlabels are all attached to the top-left corner of nodes. Is it a bug or am I misusing it?

Here is a sample code:

```
digraph g {
forcelabels=true;
ranksep=0.25;
node [shape=point,height=0.1];
""1"" [xlabel=<<FONT FACE='monospace' POINT-SIZE='4'>abc</FONT>>,xlp=""-1.0,1.0"",fillcolor=yellow,height=0.2];
""2"" [xlabel=<<FONT FACE='monospace' POINT-SIZE='4'>abc</FONT>>,xlp=""10.0,-10.0"",fillcolor=dimgray,height=0.1];
""3"" [xlabel=<<FONT FACE='monospace' POINT-SIZE='4'>abc</FONT>>,xlp=""1000.0,1000.0"",fillcolor=dimgray,height=0.1];
""1"" -> ""2""[label=<<FONT FACE='monospace' POINT-SIZE='6'>A3:B4</FONT>>,arrowsize=0.4];
""1"" -> ""3""[label=<<FONT FACE='monospace' POINT-SIZE='6'>C3:B4</FONT>>,arrowsize=0.4];
}

```

After generating a pdf (attached), all 'abc' xlabels are placed in top-left corners of nodes. Whereas I would like to control their placement myself,

preferable by specifying the location relatively to the node.

## DESCRIPTION

I really like fdp algorithm --- it is sometimes slower to run than other utilities in Graphviz but the results are excellent and I don't mind the wait. However, for some graphs it produces an image file that seems to contain no plot.

The formats I tried: png and svg

By ""seems to contain no plot"" I mean this: when viewing the result it appears to contain an empty page (no plot). The image files non-zero in size, and, when inspected in text editor, appear to be non-empty and valid structure.

Because of this I initially thought it is a viewer problem. I have tried loading svg in various svg viewers (eog, Inkscape, Firefox), then png --- eog, Firefox and Gimp --- with no luck. Loading the problematic file in eog results in ""Could not load image _graphssFdp.sv -- image loading failed"" message. Inkscake and Firefox open the file but display nothing.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

`fdp -Tsvg graphss.gv -o _graphssFdp.svg`
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I attach graphss.gv as an example file that gives rise to this problem. The files is by no means minimal, but I did not want to waste effort unless there is a clear need to reduce the input in size. The input file contains about 1,500 nodes and 2401 edges and describes an undirected graph.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:00:00-04","2020-07-20 00:09:33.976-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

I use Graphviz to layout graphs in my application. When I use statically build libraries everthing is fine. Using the DLLs from the same built process and link against these, nodes are not placed correctly, when an edge label is outside the bounding rect spanned by all nodes. I can reproduce this with 2.34 and 2.35 from 25.11.2013.

I use Graphviz only internally, and display from the given coordinates, attached is a screenshot of the problem. Once ""foo"" is moved to the left and ""bla bla"" is right of ""foo"", everything is fine. It works when using the static libraries. Internally I use dot for layout and relayout the edges using neato.

## DESCRIPTION

The pad attribute is documented to have a default value of 0.0555 (inches, equals ~4 points). However when no pad attribute is specified, xdot output behaves as though the default is 0.

From a graph that does not specify pad:

```
graph [_draw_=""c 9 -#fffffe00 C 58 -(33.03 23.43 8.11 27 18 32.45 2 0 7 -#ffffff 1 7 -#000000) P 4 0 0 0 36 54 36 54 0 "",
```

From the same graph, only modified to specify the default pad=0.0555:

```
graph [_draw_=""c 9 -#fffffe00 C 57 -(34.06 24.36 9.5 27 18 38.01 2 0 7 -#ffffff 1 7 -#000000) P 4 -4 -4 -4 40 58 40 58 -4 "",
```

Note not only the difference in the coordinates of the background polygon, but also the difference in gradient coordinates and radii.

## DESCRIPTION

From the manual page:

> The gethostbyname_() and gethostbyaddr_() functions are obsolete.  Applications should use getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) instead.

AFAIK, among the others, the getaddrinfo implements the RFC 3484, so it may be better for IPv6 or dual stack machines.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Check the code.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The code from the attached patch tries to connect to the first IP the OS things is the most suitable for the connection. In practice on dual stack machines this mostly means: if the hostname resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 IPs and IPv6 is up, the IPv6 IP is taken.

Such approach can fail if there is e.g. internal IPv6 connectivity but no external IPv6 connectivity and the AAAA records of external hostnames are still resolvable. For such cases we could retry all the returned IPs one by one in a simple loop. This would be more robust approach, but it could cause big timeouts if the network connection suddenly drops after the getaddrinfo call.

Original ID: 2389
Reported By: ryandesign

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2013-11-01 19:59:54
## DESCRIPTION

I have been asked to submit this bug report to you, on behalf of a fellow MacPorts developer.

---

Graphviz uses a check in `lib/vmalloc/features/vmalloc` that is supposed to find out whether `alloca(3)` is internally using `malloc(3)`. To do this, this check provides a custom implementation of `malloc(3)` and assumes that if this implementation is going to be called it was called by `alloca(3)`.

However, this assumption doesn't hold in all cases, e.g. it breaks when having `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` is set, as is the case for [MacPorts'] trace mode, because the Mac OS loader `dyld` internally calls `malloc(3)`, causing the check to fail.

The check should instead use a global volatile variable to check whether the current call to `malloc(3)` happened while trying to use `alloca(3)`. The overriden `malloc(3)` should behave like the standard one in all other cases.

The attached patch fixes this. Additional checks for `dlsym(3)` and `dlfcn.h` might be required.

2) Run dot using png and svg as output formats. Svg will contain ""<"" while png will contain the expected label ""<"".

[ellson] s, this is the problem we talked about.   You now need root priviledges to run make install, even if your --prefix is writable, because
library extensions are install where the language wants them.

I'm not happy with this either.  I agree that this is a bug.

VERSION: VERSION 2.27.0 (20100604.2034)
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

In x11 viewer, the navigation can be improved by the following propositions:
<CD>
- offer keyboard short cuts for zooming '-' and '_' for zooming out and '=' and '+' for zooming in. Zooming can now only be done by scroll wheel.
- also pan when M1 (first mouse button) is pressed. M3 emulation is not so handy, especially whenM1 has no function anyway.
- allow panning with arrow keys, use CTRL for smaller steps and SHIFT for bigger steps. Panning now can only be done by mouse.
- offer CTRL-Q for exit/quit
  </CD>
  <br>

Implementing these propositions will allow users to zoom and pan with more easy with device (mouse or keyboard) of their choice.

OK 
Its on the ToDo list - just no time myself right now.   If anyone wants to take a shot at coding this, the generic key-binding table is in:
    lib/gvc/gvevent.c:718
These event definitions are common to both xlib and gtk windows. 
</CD>

[pander]
Extended requirement are:
<CD>
- CTRL-R and F5 for reload
- monitor timestamp and reload automatically like evince is doing. An interval of two seconds would suffice
  </CD>

Can these be added to the bug ticket?
[ellson]
Yes, but what platform is this for?    On Linux, the X11 renderer monitors the source graph with inotify() so that it automatically updates when the source changes (try the ""vimdot"" demo"")

I don't understand why a polling mechanism would be needed if inotify() is working?

Are these only required on non-inotify() platforms? 

[pander]
I use Ubuntu and was under the impression that it was not working.  I have verified it and it seems that for large graphs, x1 is already reading the file without it is completely written. This results in an error. Would it be possible to have a setting that adds a delay to inotify?

[ellson]
I wasn't aware of this.  Possibly I'm using the wrong inotify() events....  I'll investigate.

Related to this bug, I was also trying to get an event for a new graph on stdin, but ran into a problem that the graph parser sees an empty graph on the pipe after every good graph (trailing newlines perhaps).   This is related because perhaps the right solution is to buffer input until a valid, non-empty graph can be parsed from it.

Jes, can you add that to that particular bug issue?

What would be a good default? I think full screen.

Can you also add F11 for 'real full screen' that removes the window decoration? Pressing F11 again will restore window decoration.

[ellson]
<CD>

> What would be a good default? I think full screen.
> </CD>

Maybe for cell-phone screens, but please not for my dual monitor desktop.

For ""vimdot"" two windows are opened, so full-screen would only obscure the vim window.

For small screens I do see that an option to open in full-screen mode could be useful.

A side note:  command-line option processing in graphviz is currently a mess.   If somebody wants to add options, please be prepared to look at the bigger job of cleaning up option processing in general.

Could be ok.   Are there other apps that provide this behavior this way?

On my Fedora desktop, double-clicking the window title-bar ""maximizes"" the window (not quite full-screen).   Isn't it sufficient to leave this kind of behavior to the window manager?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:05:18-04","2023-02-02 00:00:55.929-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When I try to compile Graphviz with Portage I get a load of error messages
with the topmost one: gv_java.cpp:138:17: error: jni.h: No such file or directory
I have allready added my Java Installation (jdk1.6.0_03) to my PATH
( JAVA_HOME=""/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_03"" ) (I didn't forget env-update)
But the problem still exists.
<br>

I also have the same problem with older versions of graphviz.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I really need graphviz for OMNeT++

[ellson] For a quick workaround, configure --disable-java

but first, please send me you config.log 

[andrei romanov] I'm getting the same error as described in bug #1212 while compiling
graphviz 2.12. To find out more about this error, I downloaded version
2.16 from your website and tried compiling it myself. The weird thing
is, if I run configure with the --disable-java parameter, the build
fails with the ""gv_java.cpp:138:17: error: jni.h: No such file or
directory"" message, just like the gentoo ebuild. But if I _don't_ use
the --disable-java parameter, the build compiles just fine.

Since I do have Java installed on my system, I would like to suggest
to look into the possibility that the --disable-java parameter works
incorrectly on systems with Java available.

## DESCRIPTION

In attachment input for dot where something very strange happens:
elements are placed on top of each other and arcs take strange routes.

Its seems related to using ranking in combination with subgraphs.
There are 4 ranks when it goes wrong. When combining second and third rank into one rank, the graph goes to normal.

I know there are arcs from third to second rank. No idea if this is allowed, but the result is at least not as expected.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

I don't know if this is helpfull. I could try to reduce the input, where the problem still exists, but with smaller input?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:57-04","2020-07-20 00:00:33.159-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

hi,
- when .dot file is loaded via vimdot, behavior of the xlib/x11 is ok. then after modifying .dot file via vim, file is re-rendered in xlib/x11 output
- now the issue is, when the re-rendered result is moved beyond the left or bottom window border, graph disappears/hides and it remains hidden, until i move it back via middle mouse button.

## DESCRIPTION

I used 2.30 before and was able to use the following syntax:

label=<On<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/><br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>>;
In 2.34 this creates a segmentation fault.

In the new version I can only use this: label=<On<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>>;

An also this:
Working in 2.30
label=<{<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/><B>Off</B><br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>|<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>
<u>Entry</u>:<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>LED_Off();...<br ALIGN=""LEFT""/><br
ALIGN=""LEFT""/>}>

Not working anymore (segmentation fault). I have to remove the <br
ALIGN=""LEFT""/> before the <B>Off</B>

Only this works now:
label=<{<B>Off</B><br ALIGN=""LEFT""/>| <u>Entry</u>:<br

In HTML-like labels, Graphviz already supports bold, italic, underline, subscript and superscript. Could strikethrough be supported as well?

In HTML, there are several ways to achieve strikethrough, including the ""s"", ""strike"" and ""del"" tags (and of course with CSS). If you wish to support all three tags in Graphviz HTML-like labels, then you may also want to consider supporting the ""ins"" tag (the opposite of ""del"") as a synonym for ""u"".",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:00:36-04","2020-07-28 00:02:45.98-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

- Paste the file above (please note the well-known attribute 'arrowhead' having the unknown value 'point')

This is true at least for dot, neato and circo.

Attempting to generate a layout for:

VERSION: 2.26.3
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

For Web display of (often) big schemas,
I want to set a maximum width
(users do not scroll easily on the horizontal axis)
but no maximum height
(for a given width, I want the users to be able to scroll down as much as needed).
<br>

size=""9,1000"";
ratio=compress;
is mostly doing the job.
<br>

Except if you have a loose node! It goes down under (thousand inches down!).
and you end with an enormous image where you needed a lot less.
<br>

I messed some times to identify the problem and to find a solution.
I thought it would be good to share:
just enclose your whole graph in a cluster !
<br>

My suggestions: check the ""loose node"" positionning algorithm
so it does not try to take all the surface (at least with ratio=compress).
<br>

I put hereunder a small example: just remove the subgraph to see the problem.
<br>

Good luck and THANK YOU for this fantastic tool!

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hello,
<br>

In order to draw orthogonal edges in flowchart I downloaded and installed the ""graphviz-2.27.20101013.0445.msi"" package for windows OS. It works very well, one sample is attached.
<br>

But when I wanted to add edge label with sentences like:
    splines=""ortho"";
    .....
    A -> B [label=""yes""]
an memory error occured, snapshot is also attached.
<br>

Thus I had to use:
    A -> B [headlabel=""yes""]
instead.
<br>

Hope someone could fix this problem in next edition.
<br>

Thank you.
<br>

<br>

Best regards,
<br>

Milton.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```

.....
A -> B [label=""yes""]
```

Yes, as noted in a post to the mailing list, orthogonal edges still does not
handle edge labels in dot and ports.

All edges have only the attributes dir=forward and color=green.

When the edges are green, everything works.

I have a graph representing interactions between public figures involved in the current Syria crisis.  Adding a particular ""Chuck Hagel"" -> ""Government of Russia"" link causes three other links to be duplicated 5 times for no obvious reason.  (See attached svg.)

I experienced this using the default graphviz packages that came with Ubuntu, and also the current stable ""raring"" amd64 debs from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_linux_ubuntu.php.

The command I'm using is ""dot -Tsvg syria.dot > syria.svg"".

The following description will produce semantical different
outputs, regarding if node ""R"" is put into the rank=source

a correct diagramm is renderd, but the label is missanligned.
But if once put ""R"" into the first block to ensure an special
ranking (as schown below), the position of the label is now
correct, but the direction of the arrow changed, so
that ""P"" is a successor of ""R"".

The other problem (misplaced edge label) is still there. <A HREF=""b2012.gv"">Here</A>
is a small graph exhibiting the problem. The output file shows the problem.
Note that both constraint=false and rank=source are necessary to cause the problem.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

<br>

When I run
<CD>
    C:\Programme\Graphviz2.22\bin>dot.exe -Tgif -O C:\Temp\input_with_single_nodes.dot
</CD>
with the attached input file, the program terminates with the message
<CD>
    Die Anweisung in ""0x68dd2dd2"" verweist auf Speicher in ""0x68e1c570"". Der Vorgang ""written"" konnte nicht auf dem Speicher durchgeführt werden.
</CD>
which means in English
<CD>
    The instruction at ""0x68dd2dd2"" referenced memory at ""0x68e1c570"". The memory could not be written.
</CD>
<br>

After shifting all the 'single node' lines of the form
    ""a_name,a_version_number"";
(i.e. without an '->' arrow) at the end of the file, just before the closing '}', the error message changes to (in English)
    The instruction at ""0x68dc1c68"" referenced memory at ""0x00000004"". The memory could not be read.
When doing the same on another computer with the same OS / OS version, the error messages is 
<CD>
    dot.exe hat ein Problem festgestellt und muss beendet werden
which means in English something like
    dot.exe has an error detected and has to be closed.
In this case the error signature is:
    AppName:    dot.exe
    AppVer:     0.0.0.0
    ModName:    libcairo-2.dll
    ModVer:     0.0.0.0
    Offset:     00012dd2
</CD>
The technical error report informations are quite long and may not be copied from the Window, in which they are displayed, so I send them on request only. Except for one file, which is stated to be a part of the error report, which I attach here: 5512_appcompat.txt
<br>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- When deleting the a.m. single node lines dot.exe runs fine. But I do need the single node lines. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to see nodes without connections as well.
- In addition to the error I see a warning 
  (dot.exe:5116): Pango-WARNING *_: couldn't load font ""Times Roman Not-Rotated 14"", falling back to ""Sans Not-Rotated 14"", expect ugly output.

## DESCRIPTION

I found some nasty bug in gvedit.
When you open 2 different gv-files with different graphs and you show/generate the graph ouptut png-file (F5), the first ouptut gets overwritten with the second one. Just follow the steps to reproduce.

Graphviz-Version: 2.30.1 (downloaded today) 
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Gvedit:
Load file -> Settings -> OutPutFileName = C:/Users/christoph/Uni/Lasagne.png -> Display
OK
Load another file with different FileName and different content ->Settings-> OutPutFileName=C:/Users/christoph/Uni/MOD_ER.gv ->Display
Go to the directory, check generated png files -> The first file got overwritten with content from second, so Lasagne.png has now the graph from MOD_Er

Original ID: 2336
Reported By: ryandesign

SEVERITY: NORMAL
Submitted: 2013-08-24 11:23:07

OS: OS X

OS BUILD: 10.8.4

PLATFORM: X86_64
## DESCRIPTION

When rendering xdot output for a graph using gradients, the Y-coordinate is inverted.

In the attached graph, there is a single node which should have a gradient fill from white at the bottom to black at the top.

Using the normal Graphviz coordinate system where (0,0) is in the lower left, the bounding box is drawn by the xdot command ""P 4 54 36 0 36 0 0 54 0"", so the top is at 36 and the bottom is at 0.

But the gradient fill is specified by the xdot command ""C 42 -[27 -0 27 -36 2 0 7 -#ffffff 1 7 -#000000]"", so the gradient starts at white at coordinate (27,-0) and ends at black at coordinate (27,-36) -- off the bottom of the canvas!

The correct gradient fill specification would be ""C 40 -[27 0 27 36 2 0 7 -#ffffff 1 7 -#000000]"".

So far in my tests, I can just flip the sign of the Y-coordinate.

In inverted-Y mode (""dot -y"") the gradient is specified by ""C 41 -[27 36 27 72 2 0 7 -#ffffff 1 7 -#000000]"" so I can make that work by subtracting the Y-coordinates from the height.

Since this bug was released in a stable version of Graphviz 2.32.0, you might consider increasing the xdotversion to 1.4.1 when fixing this bug, so that xdot renderers can detect the buggy version 1.4 and translate the coordinates in that case.

OS: OS X

PLATFORM: X86_64
## DESCRIPTION

I've been trying to improve the accuracy of my xdot renderer, Canviz. Text position has always been a bit off, and in trying to get to the bottom of it I've concluded that Graphviz isn't giving me consistent information. The Y-coordinate of text in _*draw_ commands varies based on whether the text came from a normal label or an HTML-like label with an embedded font face tag.

In the attached test graph there are two nodes side by side rendering the same string of text, one using a normal label, and one using an HTML-like label with an embedded font face tag. Since coordinates in xdot format are interpreted at 72 points per inch, I've set the graph dpi to 72 so that the png version is comparable.

I would expect both nodes to look identical. In the png rendering, in fact the text drawn using the HTML-like label with an embedded font face tag is one pixel up from where it should be. I would say that's a bug.

The bigger surprise comes in the xdot output, where the text from the HTML-like label with font face tag is 2.8 points up from where it should be. I cannot explain this inconsistency compared with png the output.

There's also some small horizontal positioning difference between a normal label and an HTML-like label with font face tag that I can't account for.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

dot -Tpng -ofont2.gv.png -Txdot -ofont2.gv.xdot font2.gv
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

A normal label and an HTML-like label that _doesn't_ use an embedded font face tag do look identical.

Even though there is plenty of horizontal space, the red edge becomes much longer when the text is changed. It should stay at its current size.

## DESCRIPTION

One of the nodes in a graph seems to be ""split"" and is drawn twice. It seems to affect all of the tools, but the problem is particularly dramatic in the case of circo, where the duplicate node is drawn outside the circle.

/usr/local/bin/neato -Tpng anon.gv -o anon.png

14 nodes are drawn, two of which with the same label - ""rt"". One of the edges goes to one version of the node, the remaining edges go to the other. If you change the order the nodes appear in the file, a different node is affected by the duplication.

## DESCRIPTION

When using cairo (1.12.14) output (""-Tpng""), the kerning (the spacing between characters) is not accurate, especially at small font sizes. Based on observation, it appears to me that each character is positioned based on the specified font size, and that each character's position is rounded to the nearest integer, and then later, that's scaled to the graph's dpi. In the extreme case of very small font size and very large dpi (see attached graph with 1pt font size and 3000 dpi), this results in very poor rendering. This example may be contrived, but the problem was apparent to me at larger font sizes as well, which prompted me to investigate.

SEVERITY: TWEAK
Submitted: 2013-08-07 20:29:44
## DESCRIPTION

The Python Package Index, located at https://pypi.python.org/pypi is intended to list all public distributions of python language libraries (modules and packages). PyPI is analogous to ""CPAN"" for the perl language. As a very complete public resource, it is the basis for many commonly-used tools, such as ""pip"", ""virtualenv"", and ""easy_install"". PyPI currently has no listing for ""gv"" or ""gv_python"", although it has many entries for third-party ""non-canonical"" packages that interact with Graphviz. The lack of a ""gv"" entry makes it less convenient to use this library in a variety of environments, e.g. on a shared host. Because it's not in PyPI, many python developers are likely not even to be aware of this library, and many more will eschew it for Graphviz packages that are better integrated into their workflow.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

To fix this, someone on the project needs to register at this page:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form

Then the entry for ""gv"" must be created. This may be done at this page:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form

Tools like ""pip"" are pretty good at finding packages to install and use even if very minimal information is provided in this form.

Asking dot, neato or twopi to parse the following:

    testNode2 [label=<<TABLE><TR><TD><I><u>A</u></I></TD></TR></TABLE>>];
}

results in:

Error - pango_parse_markup: Error on line 1 char 33: '1' is not a valid name

An output file is produced despite the error message. It seems the HTML string is unescaped twice. If pango_parse_markup() fails to parse it, the result turns out as expected. Otherwise pango interprets the string again.

In the example testNode1 doesn't parse and produces the error message. testNode2 does parse as pango markup and results in underlined text, which is wrong.

Furthermore the location of the error (line 1 char 33) doesn't seem to be related to the actual input file.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Run dot, neat or twopi on the attached input file:

Original ID: 2315
Reported By: ryandesign

SEVERITY: FEATURE
Submitted: 2013-07-29 06:39:25
## DESCRIPTION

Currently, gradients are not reflected in xdot output, but I'd like them to be. I need to know the start and end points (and for radial gradients, the start and end radii) and for each color stop, the percentage along the line and the color value at that point.

Two possible implementations occur to me:
1. The gradient information could be encoded in the existing ""C"" and ""c"" fill and pen color commands, for example using the CSS gradient specifications:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient

The advantage of method (1) would be not needing to add new commands to XDOT. The disadvantage is that existing renderers are unlikely to be able to use those colors without needing to parse them.
1. Alternately, new commands could be invented (e.g. ""G"" (linear gradient fill), ""g"" (linear gradient pen), ""R"" (radial gradient fill), ""r"" (radial gradient pen)) and you could invent a syntax for communicating the positions and color stops. For example:

G x1 y1 x2 y2 n [p m -b1b2...bn]
Set fill linear gradient, along a line from x1,y1 to x2,y2, with n color stops. For each color stop at position p, the color value consists of the m bytes following '-'. (The values in square brackets repeat n times.)

R x1 y1 r1 x2 y2 r2 n [p m -b1b2...bn]
Set fill radial gradient, starting from a circle centered at x1,y1 with radius r1, ending at a circle centered at x2,y2 with radius r2, with n color stops. For each color stop at position p, the color value consists of the m bytes following '-'. (The values in square brackets repeat n times.)

The advantage of method (2) would be that you could provide a solid color fallback for renderers that can't do gradients, and any renderer that wants to do gradients can easily acquire all the required parameters without needing to do any further parsing of a color string other than the already-required parsing of the XDOT draw commands.

If new commands are added to XDOT, I would recommend increasing the xdotversion to 1.3, as was done previously when the ""I"" command was added in xdotversion 1.2.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:06:31-04","2022-07-09 00:02:11.581-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

Most coordinates in xdot output are rounded to integers, resulting in imprecise output in some situations. See #2317 for one example. While allowing arbitrary precision floating point numbers would bloat the output considerably, I think the increased file size caused by using one or two digits after the decimal point would be a worthwhile tradeoff for the increased accuracy.

I suggest all numbers in xdot output should be displayed with 2 digits after the decimal place, removing any trailing zeroes.

Not all numbers in xdot are rounded to integers, even when some should be. Font sizes, for example, are specified unnecessarily precisely with no benefit, i.e.:

_ldraw_=""F 14.000000 11 -Times-Roman c 9 -#000000ff T 27 12 0 19 3 -red ""

could have just as accurately been represented as:

_ldraw_=""F 14 11 -Times-Roman c 9 -#000000ff T 27 12 0 19 3 -red ""

Come to think of it, when a color's opacity is 100%, that doesn't need be to listed either, does it?

I created a graph where the edges (not the nodes) contain most information. Unfortunately the output is almost unreadable. I'm a beginner and I expected dot to do the layout ""right"" without many rendering hints.

Original ID: 793
Reported By: Emanuele Ruffaldi

SEVERITY: FEATURE
Submitted: 2005-01-08 08:34:16

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.0
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I had the necessity to add interactivity to the SVG graph generated by dot.
In particular to be able to associate the start and end node to a
specific edge.
<br>

In the current SVG generation nodes are numbered as node# where # is odd and
edge# where # is pair. The problem is that there is no possibility
to retrieve the end and start node from the edge#. This information
is fundamental in an SVG graph where I navigate graphically the edges, and
blink the end node when the navigation is terminated.
<br>

To retreive this information I had to patch the generated SVG by using the
node/edge information from the DOT file. I've chosen the following notation
for the id=""edge#"" allowing to preserve the original semantic and
adding the node values:
<br>

edge#-#FROM#-#NODE#
<br>

This solution is really simple to implement, e.g.
<br>

edge10-15-33
<br>

is the edge 10, that connects the node 15th with 33rd
<br>

Great job with dot!

Original ID: 2293
Reported By: RunnyNode

SEVERITY: CRITICAL
Submitted: 2013-06-09 13:23:08

OS: WINDOWS XP

OS BUILD: SP3

PLATFORM: X86
## DESCRIPTION

There's already been a report of the installer wiping out Path. I've found that the problem is a little more complicated, which may be why not everybody is reproducing it (if you don't look closely, you won't see what's happening). Rather than simply overwriting Path, the MSI installer seems to be removing _part_ of the existing Path. In my case, I had:

%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\totalcmd;I:\EmEditor;I:\PellesC\Bin;I:\LilyPond\usr\bin;I:\LAME;I:\Csound\bin;I:\SBCL\;I:\sox;I:\VstPlugins\Unusual\Studio Units;I:\GTK2-Runtime\bin

After installing Graphviz, this became:

%GTK_BASEPATH%\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\totalcmd;I:\Graphviz2.30\bin

Looks like it's killing everything after the _first_ app-specific entry (in this case, everything after C:\totalcmd). Obviously, Graphviz (which rocks) isn't going to win any friends if it mysteriously breaks all sorts of other software when it's installed! Hence the high priority.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Install on Windows using the version 2.30.1 MSI installer, while having a Path environment variable with several app-specific folders in it (obviously, you should save your Path variable before trying this!).

Original ID: 2260
Reported By: camillo

SEVERITY: IMPORTANT
Submitted: 2013-02-17 09:04:30
## DESCRIPTION

You can mostly use UTF-8 with Graphviz (and the Python module pygraphviz relies on this), but sometimes UTF-8 strings are broken when writing out a graph using agwrite. This happens because _agstrcanon attempts to insert a backslash and a LF when the current line is longer than 80 characters: if the break occurs in the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence, invalid output is produced.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Use pygraphviz to create a graph, give it a Unicode label containing a bunch of non-ASCII characters, then write out the graph. Pad the string if necessary to ensure that the 80-character point comes in the middle of a multibyte sequence.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I am attaching a patch that fixes this issue by ensuring that multi-byte UTF-8 sequences are not broken. There should be no impact on plain ASCII, and minimal on other encodings (e.g. ISO Latin-1, assuming it is even supported) as long as there are no huge blocks of bytes with values > 127. Even then, breaking long lines is mostly a cosmetic issue.

## DESCRIPTION

When adding ""aspect=1.3;"" to the parameters, wrong (additional) edges are drawn.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Run ""dot -Tsvg test.dot > test.svg"" (on the attached file).
2. Note that there are five edges from node 60 to node 59 in test.svg, whereas test.dot contains only one.

## DESCRIPTION

Owing to an upgrade from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion, I had to go from graphviz 2.28 to 2.30.1.
In previously working tcl code, all graph nodes now point to themselves instead of to the head node...

I believe that the issue lies in the file tcldot-graphcmd.c.

The lines form 106 that read:
        head = cmd2n(argv[2]);
        if (!head) {
        if (!(head = agfindnode(g, argv[3]))) {
        Tcl_AppendResult(interp, ""Head node \"""", argv[3], ""\"" not found."", NULL);
        return TCL_ERROR;
        }
        }
should extract the head from argv[3] not argv[2]

As you can see there is an edge from n1 to n1
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Workaround. There is a workaround (which involves changing the tcl source):
Use ""$n1 addedge $n2"" instead of ""$g addedge $n1 $n2]""

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm using dot(1) to create an animated GIF.  The idea is
that the graph will ""fill in"" over time, as new nodes
and edges become visible.  Meanwhile, the geometry will
remain constant.
<br>

Unfortunately, it appears that the ""invis"" attribute for
edges conflicts a bit with the ""concentrate"" attribute
for graphs.
<br>

I have enclosed two images. In the <A HREF=b470a.gif>first</A>, everything
is visible.  In the second, most nodes and edges have
become invisible.  Note, however, that the first part
of the concentrated set of edges from OCS is invisible.
<br>

This seems to be due to the fact that the edge from OCS
to DAB is invisible.  But, since the other edges from
OCS are visible, I think they should be visible along
their entire lengths (including the portion shared with
the ""OCS->DAB"" edge).

## DESCRIPTION

I created a large-ish tree that is processed wit dot.
Nodes in the tree are marked with a »cluster« so gvmap can create a map based on that.
When not having any labels in the graph, this works perfectly.
Once I add the labels which are multiline and have varying widths, the map created by gvmap can have a slight offset in some places, causing the nodes to lie not entirely in their assigned region of the map or 
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

I provide four example files at http://earthlingsoft.net/ssp/misc/graphviz/

The working case is »input-simple.gv«, each node only has a small ID there which is used as the label. It gives the correct output file »output-simple.svg« after using

dot input-simple.gv | gvmap -e | dot -Tsvg

The IMO erroneous case is given by »input.gv«. Here the nodes contain larger labels and end up having varying sizes. Running

dot input-simple.gv | gvmap -e | dot -Tsvg

gives the output file »output.svg«. Here some nodes overlap the map boundaries (e.g. 273, 332, 479, 491, …) or  lie completely outside their country on the map (e.g. 501, 183).

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Hi,
Is the issues are generated because of the gcc version?
How to fix it cause my install is not complete?
For example, I can't use dot, got an error message:
""dot: error while loading shared libraries: libgvc.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory""
despite that the libgvc.so.2 is in my local lib directory /udd/broy/local/lib

Thanks..

[ellson] I don't know what the problem is.  I build graphviz every night on FC4 without these errors.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]
Did you install the graphviz-tcl rpm ?

If you install webdot from rpms it should pull it in automatically.

[tao]
Yes, I installed graphviz-tcl. Here is the command I used to install the package:

yum install graphviz graphviz-devel graphviz-doc graphviz-gd raphviz-graphs graphviz-perl graphviz-tcl perl-GraphViz webdot

The same installation worked in CentOS 5.5 x86 version, but not work in CentOS5.5 x86_64 version. I think some library is not compatible with 64 bit OS. Even if I manually compiled graphviz and webdot from source code, I got the same error.

[ellson]
I run of 64bits all the time.  I assume you installed the x86_64 rpms?

I may have complicated things by updating the library API versions yesterday.

Could you try this:   Remove all graphviz\* rpms, remove any other graphviz installs that maybe in your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
install fresh rpms from today's snapshot.

[tao]
I have tried again as you suggested on a new built CentOS 5.6 64bits system with latest updates, but got the same error as before when view the dot image in browser.

The command used for graphviz installation is:

yum --enablerepo=graphviz-snapshot install graphviz graphviz-devel graphviz-doc graphviz-gd graphviz-graphs graphviz-tcl webdot.noarch perl-GraphViz.noarch

All rpms and dependencies are installed with no problems. Versions installed are:

</CD>

BTW, there is duplicated ""/usr/bin/tclsh"" in second line in /var/www/cgi-bin/webdot.

[ellson]
I don't know why this doesn't work.

The rpm (in webdot.spec) is supposed to discover where the tcldot extension is located by using:
    %define libtcldot  %(rpm -ql graphviz-tcl | grep '/libtcldot.so.0.0.0$')

and then insert it into the webdot script in the second line:
    set LIBTCLDOT ""%{libtcldot}""

I suggest, as a work-around, until I can think of a replacement mechanism, that you apply the above fix manually.

## DESCRIPTION

When compiled with recent enough gcc (I tried 4.7.2) with -O2 (as many distros already do) the -fstrict-overflow is in effect and the integer overflow in the code must be avoided, because it is undefined, compilation log:

> shortest.c:539:8: warning: assuming signed overflow does not occur when assuming that (X + c) < X is always false [-Wstrict-overflow]
> ...
> graph_generator.c:156:3: warning: assuming signed overflow does not occur when assuming that (X + c) < X is always false [-Wstrict-overflow]
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Compile with -O2 (or -fstrict-overflow) with recent enough gcc (e.g. 4.7.2).
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

As there are only two places in the code when this happen, it should be easily fixable. This should be fixed also for portability reason, because compilers other than gcc may handle the overflow its own way. I attached the patch that should fix the first case (maybe on the failed check the abort may be better than the return).

For the second case, I am not sure how to fix it the best way, but the solution should be similar.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Nodes on twopi circles need to be controllable regarding orientation and positioning on circle because not they are overlapping way too often, especially on the top and bottom.
<br>

The nodes should be rotated in such a way that they get an orientation in line with their position on the circle and the center of that circle. Also, the nodes need to aligned on the outside of the circle, centered on the circle and on the inside of the circle.
<br>

Please see this <A HREF=""b1968.png"">image</A> explaining results of proposed orientation settings for twopi:
<br>

Please, also see the example code included in this report.
<br>

Implementing this will increase the quality of twopi graphs because the end user has to ability to prevent node overlapping in by proposed means of auto-orientation and node alignment on circle.

## DESCRIPTION

When trying to generate a graph using neato with splines for a 17 nodes network (with fixed position for the nodes), I get either segmentation fault of glibc if the number of edges is sufficiently large and sep is not small enough.
If a given value of sep returns a segmentation fault, decreasing a little I get glibc and if I decrease it sufficiently, I get a clean run. Depending on the situation, that means that the output is not good for visualization due to the very small value of sep.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

With the following graph, if sep=0.4 it works. sep=1 gives glibc and sep=2 gives segmentation fault. With this particular case the 0.4 value is ok for visualization, even though a larger value would be better, but for other cases I must set sep=0.2, get a glibc and manualy (ctrl+c) kill the process  to get the graph, which ends up with some of the splines drawn as polylines.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:00:35-04","2022-06-18 00:08:08.693-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Original ID: 2231
Reported By: Gabriel Marin

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2012-05-31 18:37:23
## DESCRIPTION

When nslimit is used, it is possible that some nodes may still overlap or that the solution is degenerate. This can cause serious problems during spline routing as that code assumes no node overlap, in which case dot may crash. Or spline routing may run forever.

As a second problem, there is the question as to why it is necessary to set nslimit. This is a ""bad"" graph in that it is very long with many very long edges, so the dummy node blowup is large. But it is still hard to believe that network simplex shouldn't be able to handle it.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hi,
<br>

When generating an emf meta file output the dotted and dashed linestyles appear to be ignored.
<br>

The sample works correctly when rending a gif output.
<br>

The command line is ""dot -Temf -O Graph.dot"".
<br>

Until recently, I have used version ""uwin98 (01-26-98)"", but this will not work on Server 2008 - understandably. I generated EMF output with the WinGraphViz COM components (with very poor rendering of lines).
<br>

The new version EMF support was very welcome and I hope that I am doing something incorrect rather than have found a bug.
<br>

In the last 5 years I have frequently used your tool to generate elegant drawings that can be rapidly re-generated and really appreciate the support. I have also used the UBET tool for small protocol analysis exercises and was amused to see Dot embedded.
<br>

Regards,
Pekka

}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I saw that there is support for line styles in gpcanvas.c for Windows meta files, but have not reviewed the current full code base to see if it is still active.

[arif]
The problem is gdiplus  renderer does not seem supporting styles  and emf is only available via gdiplus since it is window's native metafile format.We need to extend our rtests to cover gdi plus too.

[erg]
Is it that the gdiplus renderer does not support styles, or that we have implemented them?

[arif]
It  supports dashed lines,i cant tell whether it supports others.
But it is obvious that our gdiplus code is not complete.

[ellson]
<CD>

> Is it that the gdiplus renderer does not support styles, or that we have implemented them?
> </CD>

Looks like the latter to me.  I see no code for setting pen style in plugin/gdiplus/gvrender_gdiplus.cpp.

I think this code came from Glen Low.

[pekka]
The Windows metafile PenStyle enumeration is documented (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc231188(v=PROT.10).aspx) and supports 5 native line styles including the ones provided in the dot language.

## DESCRIPTION

Hello,

I'm using graphviz's libgvc to generate graphs that heavily rely on clusters. It works fine with small graphs, but when they get bigger (hundreds of nodes, many more edges) I get this message:

Error: trouble in init_rank
        virtual 1
        virtual 2
        virtual 1
        virtual 2
...

In version 2.26 (debian repositories), the gvLayout generation crashes on me.
In version 2.28 and 2.29 dev, it goes through with the generation, but the positioning of some clusters and nodes is messed up, rendering the graph unusable.

Same thing happens when I generate it through commandline with ""dot -Tps file .dot"".

Do you have any suggestions on how I might tackle this problem?

Thank you,
Xavier

which uses drawing type 'B', which is B-spline. 

According to the documentation http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dxdot I assume it should be 'p' as used by the nodes or 'L'. 

In the opposite does the _draw_ attribute of the 'A' node uses the expected type 'p'

VERSION: 2.26.3
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

sincos check in configure claims to verify if libm provides sincos, but
in fact it doesn't use -lm and with newer versions of GCC (4.3+) this
actually checks if GCC provides sincos, which is not the same.
On FreeBSD libm doesn't provide sincos, but configure decides that it
does if GCC 4.3+ is used for build and that causes link failures because
actual binaries are being linked with libm.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]
I don't think I understand.  If configure finds a sincos in gcc libs, why is that incompatible with -lm ?

Anyway  I have no way to test BSD  builds.   Could you generate a patch that works for you please?

[andriy]
I _think_ (far from sure) that if -lm is not explicitly specified then GCC uses
its ""built-in"" math functions, but if there is -lm, then it suppresses its code
and expects all functions to be provided in libm.so.
That's my assumption.

> Anyway  I have no way to test BSD  builds.   Could you generate a patch

[andriy]
One less mystery - I also have my CFLAGS set to ""-O2 ..."" and apparently GCC 4.3+
is smarter than before, and it simply optimized away sincos(PI/2.0) call and
replaced results with constants.  So the check was effective a NOOP.
Resetting CFLAGS to -O0 resulted in correct detection, -O1 was already too much of
optimization.

I think that GCC-specific attribute could be used to force optimization level for
this test, something like ""**attribute**((**optimize**(0)))"".
But I am not sure if that would be a right thing to do.

In any case, I think that this check should use -lm to work correctly, otherwise
it would fail if sincos is not optimized out.  It's a case of two bugs canceling
each other, at least on Linux  :) 

[ellson]
So, if I understand, it was mistakenly finding sincos() on BSD because the compiler was too clever.

I've tried to make the configure test defeat the optimizer.   Now, if it doesn't find sincos() it should just use the regular sin(),cos().

I can't use gcc-specific flags because we don't always use gcc for graphviz builds.

Please see if tomorrow's snapshot works for you.

Yes, exactly.

You outsmarted the compiler, the check works correctly in my environment now.
Thanks a lot!

However, please double-check that it doesn't mistakingly fail in Linux

## DESCRIPTION

A software project I am working on occasionally generates .dot files that caused an older and most recent build of Graphviz to hang on Mac Snow Leopard and GNU/Linux.  Running the command-line dot on the file will print this error before dot hangs:

libpath/shortest.c:315: triangulation failed
libpath/shortest.c:198: cannot find triangle path

I looked at one of the problematic .dot files and line-by-line removed everything except what is required to reproduce the bug.  It's rather delicate, and _even the order of the node variables_ is important.  (That's not to say the bug is rare and unimportant: with my much larger, more complex generated graph the bug arises frequently).  For example, if you move the definition of the 'A0' node (defined on line 8) to between lines 9 and 10, the error will go away and allow you to see essentially what the graph looks like.

Node and edge colors are not essential to the bug, but I added them to the dot file to make the problem easier to visualize.  I suspect the source of the problem is in the visualization has something to do with the nodes C11, C15, and C17, which, under specific circumstances, need to be visualized in close proximity.

The ordering and everything is very important to have the bug reproduced.

SEVERITY: FEATURE

## DESCRIPTION

The stylesheet graph attribute assumes that the stylesheet is CSS format. It's also permissible (and very useful) to use an XSL stylesheet, which can automatically transform the content of the SVG before displaying it (assuming the viewer correctly interprets it). Browsers such as Safari do currently perform this transformation automatically.

By allowing the XSL stylesheet to be correctly attached, GraphViz SVG output can be immediately transformed in compliant browsers without additional steps or tools, prior to rendering. Since the full XSLT 1.0 language is available, the opportunities to transform the result would provide a means to solve many of the transformations on SVG that are requested.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

from gv_render_core.c -- we see the following code that inserts the stylesheet name, but assumes a type of text/css.

 if ((s = agget(job->gvc->g, ""stylesheet"")) && s[0]) {
        gvputs(job, ""<?xml-stylesheet href=\"""");
        gvputs(job, s);
        gvputs(job, ""\"" type=\""text/css\""?>\n"");
    }

GraphViz could support an ""xslStylesheet"" attribute, which would attach the stylesheet, emitting a header like this:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?>
<?xml-stylesheet href=""%xslStylesheet%"" type=""application/xml""?>

## DESCRIPTION

In my directed graph I'm using record shapes for items. Also I'm using single- and both-way directed arrows, and nondirectional lines, too. There's a behaviour problem of graphviz, I cannot solve:

1st: In case, when many different single- and both-way directed arrows, and nondirectional lines go to such item, graphviz arranged them meeting at the same position. In case I wanted them to be grouped, that would be OK, but there's no optical difference between the lines with no arrow at this position and the others, because they all start from the same position. Is ther any flag to seperate them?...

My “wannabe workaround” is for example:

b[ shape=record rankdir=LR label=”{ { <f0> | <f1> | <f2> } | Nodename | { <f3> | <f4> | <f5> } }“];

a1->b:f0;
a2->b:f1;
a3->b:f2;

b:f3 -> c1;
b:f4 -> c2;
b:f5 -> c3;

but then I can't get the f1...f5 ports invisible :o(

2nd: On a higher level I'm trying here to visualize a ”run-through” some elements. As if there was a nondirectional relation between the nodes a1 and c1 running through node b, whereas a2 would bidirectionally related with c2 running through node b and a3 would be single-directionally related with c3 also running through node b. If the “entering” lines/arrows meet at the same position and the outgoing lines/arrows too, there's no possibility to distinguish them (i.e. which entering part of a relation running through such node belongs to which outgoing part).

3rd: Due to a better legibility of my graph I also would like to have the alternative chance to define or fix the positions of such items (and/or the course of such arrow-curves, if possible), because of the “random look like” of theirs positioning now. Is there any prioritizing mechanism which allows to arrange either the graph nodes (items) or the arrows/curves (relations between them) like a minimum spanning tree or something like that? It would be helpful... because of giving the edges an explicit weight doesn't really help.

I've been trying some quick and dirty solutions like:
overlap=scale;
splines=true;
and/or

samehead=false;
sametail=false;

but tey didn't causy any effect.

Is there maybe a flag like “as straight and short as possible” for creating the edges and placing the nodes depending on that priority?...

Thanks for your help, if possible...

## DESCRIPTION

Hello all,

primary I'm looking for a possibility to put all my "".png""-images in a folder and load them via ""http"" and to generate from a "".dot"" file a"".png""- or "".jpg""-Graph. Unfortunately I didn't find out, whether it's possible or not.

Can you help me with a code example, if it's possible?...

On my 2nd attempt I decided to put all these images to a folder using the ""imagepath"" attribute and tried to create a work around:

digraph G
{
  imagepath=""~/Desktop/png/"";
  a[ shape=box image=""a.png"" ];
  b[ shape=box image=""b.png"" ];
  a->b;
}

alternatively

digraph G
{
  imagepath=""/home/username/Desktop/png/"";
  a[ shape=box image=""a.png"" ];
  b[ shape=box shapefile=""b.png"" ];
  a->b;
}

...both versions also didn't work:

Warning: No such file or directory while opening a.png
Warning: No or improper image=""a.png"" for node ""a""
Warning: No such file or directory while opening b.png
Warning: No or improper shapefile=""b.png"" for node ""b""

... and so on :o(

Can you help me with a code example, how to deal with the ""imagepath"" parameter due to my intentions?...

Thanks

This expr stuff is for creating Windows compatible version strings.   Probably we can find a way to avoid executing it on other platforms...

[ellson] On the suspicion that /usr/bin/expr is broken on HPUX, I've put in a change to configure.ac to avoid
running expr except for the Windows builds.

The change should be in tomorrow's snapshot. 

[glen] expr is not the broken thing here. It's the use of the construct ${XXX:n:m} which is supposed to be POSIX-compliant, but perhaps HPUX's shell isn't up to scratch.

## DESCRIPTION

After creating a node in dotty by clicking on empty area, it can be drag'n'dropped only once, then it becomes unclickable (cannot be drag'n'dropped - a new node appears at end point instead as if I tried to drag'n'drop an empty space; cannot create an edge by mouse3 click etc.) Generally, after creating and drag'n'dropping, a node becomes unclickable in a random or in an uncertain way. ""Layout"" command restores the clickable state.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. In dotty, create an empty view.
2. Create a new node.
3. Drag'n'drop it somewhere.
4. Try to drag'n'drop it somewhere once more.
   (if it acts normally, create some more nodes and drag'n'drop them, then try to drag'n'drop the initial node)",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:03:02-04","2023-01-05 00:01:39.122-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Original ID: 1199
Reported By: Michael Mueller

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2007-11-13 03:10:49

OS: SPARC-SOLARIS-2.8

VERSION: 2.16
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I have an issue with the layout from Neato when I compile it on our Sparc machine.
<br>

When it draws even a simple test dot file it lays out the graph in a seemingly
haphazard way.  See examples below,
When I try it under cygwin (graphviz 2.8) it seems OK,
Not sure what I can check,   I am using the latest PNG and JPG libraries and freetype2
I'm outputting in svg but the problem persists in any output format.
<br>

command used for example
`/opt/graphviz/bin/neato -Tpng test.dot -o ONE.png`
<br>

Only thing I can think of is if a default setting has changed in Neato
with this version?
<br>

BTW I did try  the 2.8 version it draws the smaller graphs like the one in the example OK
but on larger graphs with some Orphaned nodes and branches it seems to place
them around the circumference of the diagram in a circular fashion. Again
this was only an issue on the Sun Machine and it  laid out OK under cygwin.
<br>

Thanks for you assistance.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] Unfortunately, neato runs fine on your graph using our Solaris machine, so it is going to be hard for us
to determine what is going wrong. You might try running neato -v on your file and sending out the log.
Also, it may be helpful to know how you built Graphviz, i.e., what options did you use when you ran

[michael] Here is the  configure I ran  (the /opt/imagelibs  directory  contains the
latest versions of png jpeg and freetype libraries.)
<CD>

```

it didn't exit by itself after quite some time so not sure if it is

[north] I wonder if the layout is OK but there are scaling issues (font problems?)

The layout is obviously not ""totally random"" as was suggested.
This is crucial to understanding what actually went wrong.

[michael] What steps could I take to determine if it is a Font issue.

I didn't specifically use fontconfig in the configure params, I am not
really sure how fontconfig fits in with the standard Solaris font handling.

[north] run dot -v

I doubt you have fontconfig unless you installed it.

That being said, I wonder if we have a scaling error (e.g. 96/72) when
we fall back to internal font sizing. 

[ellson] 
There are no textlayout plugins, so it is using some internal font metrics.
I'm not sure if this is actually the cause of the problem you are seeing, but you will get
better layouts if you install: fontconfig, cairo, pango.
<CD>

```
   http://fontconfig.org/
   http://cairographics.org/
   http://www.pango.org/   Your version of gd has not been built with fontconfig either, so you should rebuild it too.
```

</CD>

BTW.  You would save yourself a lot of configure options if you installed graphviz in
a common prefix with all the other packages, e.g. /opt/imagelibs
<prefix>/lib and <prefix>/include are automatically searched for all libs/headers.

<CD>

> it didn't exit by itself after quite some time so not sure if it is
> complete.
> </CD>

If there is no input file on the command line, dot reads input from stdin, so it is just waiting for input.
Use <ctrl>D  to provide an EOF.

[erg] As John noted, neato is waiting for some input.
Please try running neato -v on your graph file and sending us that log.

[michael]
Here is the result of using -v option

I recompiled again using some different options as I had been playing
around trying to compile fontconfig etc with out luck and had it stopped
graphviz building

```
./configure  --with-freetype2=no --with-fontconfig=no
--prefix=/opt/imagelibs --with-gdk-pixbuf=no

The output is the same as before.

Also, in response to Stephen's request to try mode=KK, you got

<CD>

> final e = 22.610892 0 iterations 0.00 sec
> </CD>

So, now the question is, why is neato stopping prematurely?

A separate issue is the fact that dot is not finding a Times-Roman font, but since you are building without
freetype, you will necessarily get the libgd default fonts.

[michael]  I am running gnu make and gcc

I did as you suggested
and ran doit which contained this command

```
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../..  -I../.. -I../../lib/common -I../../lib/gvc

however it only created/update the  stuff.o  file
ls -ltr

A search of the entire source tree did not show a stuff.i file? maybe that
is cc specific.

I have attatched the <A HREF=""b1230.i"">stuff.o</A> file in anycase.

[erg] Okay, that shot down my theory, though I still think I'm on the right
track.

Please, when you get time, would you add the line

  fprintf (stderr, ""%f %f %f\n"", e, save_e, fabs((e - save_e) / save_e));

after line 554 in lib/neatogen/stuff.c

but fabs((e - save_e)/save_e) = 0, hence neato stops. A similar situation
is must be occurring with stress majorization. The obvious bug is that
fabs is not declared to be returning a double, but the output of cc -E
on stuff.c show that fabs() is properly declared.

On the surface, this appears to be compiler/linker bug. As a simple
test, Michael should try compiling and running

<CD>

```
#include <math.h>

main ()
{
static double save_e = 1.7976931348623157e+308;
double e = 22.610892;

if (fabs((e - save_e) / save_e) < 1e-5)
  printf (""bad\n"");
else
  printf (""good\n"");
}
```

</CD>
to see if this triggers the bug.

[michael] Thanks Emden, it gives me something to work with,   the GCC version is 3.2
and it was not generating any errors.   I will try a later version of GCC
and see how I go.  I will tell you the results.

[michael] Hi Emden,
I tried the fno-inline flag and compiled and it worked ok,  though it was
layed out slightly differently to how it is in windows.
The thing is I realised that I compiled it with out the JPEG or png
libraries,   When I recompiled it and added those libraries it stopped
working again .
However since the png and jpg library paths are now a bit polluted by all
the other installs I have done I will attempt to reinstall them from fresh
and compile again with the fno-inline flag.
here is the test.s file from the first install

(See attached file: <A HREF=""b1230.s"">b1230.s</A>).

I'm trying to use a custom shape defined in an .svg file

have a viewBox so, at the very least, it should be possible to put the

that tag inside the <g> for the node. Currently, the <g> tags for the
nodes only have <title> tags inside them.

I get an error if I put the wrong file name in a node's
image attribute, so I think the backend reads the shape SVG. If my SVG
is missing something, please consider adding a check and printing a

<br>

If the inverted triangle node shape (invtriangle) is used,
and connections are made to the flat top of the triangle via
the northern ports, the resulting edges miss the flat top of the
triangle by a significant amount. The result suggests that in
this case the edge-positioning code ignores the invtriangle
attribute and substitutes a default shape (ellipse?).

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]
This problem is related to the port code.  See modified example: 
<A HREF=""b1921.gv"">input</A> and <A HREF=""b1921.png"">output</A>.

[ellson]
Thanks for the report.  I've applied a fix for this particular case which should be in tomorrow's snapshot.

We still need more cleanup of compassPort placement code.  I think e,w ports on assymetric shapes will still fail at the moment.

[chris]
Thanks for the update. I enclose another related but distinct case which
might be interesting. It also uses invtriangle but with all three north
ports connected. In this case NW and NE intersect the top of the node, but N
does not. Note that this example fails with other node shapes besides
invtriangle, e.g. try it with house or invhouse.

I can submit this via the bug reports form if you prefer.

I'm curious about the nature of the problem. Do shapes have some data that
defines where their ports are? And if so, do the inverted shapes have their
own data, or are they handled by flipping the ports around the origin?

In other words, would it be helpful to try all the nodes shapes against
these two cases of mine? I will volunteer to do this if it's helpful. 

The problem was affecting N,S,E,W but not NE,NW, SE,SW which were
slightly better coded.

[ellson]
The problem only affects asymmetric shapes: N,S, if the shape is
asymmetric vertically, and E,W if the shape is asymmetric horizontally

I've put in a partial fix for N,S, but haven't fixed E,W yet.   The code
really needs to be recoded
to accept a port at any angle; instead of the case statement in which
the same code is repeated multiple times, or not if it didn't seem too
important ;-)

If you're interested, the code that needs rewriting is in
lib/common/shapes.c  in the compassPort()
function.   I think a better coding would be to convert the compass
request to an angle,
find the intersection of that angle from the node center to the node
bounding box, then use the edge clipping code to work back to the
intersecion with the polygon.   Basically we shouldn't be using a case
statement at all.

The fix I've applied works for your other example.  See attached.
You can see my fix so far with:
<CD>
      cvs diff -u -r1.140 -r1.141 lib/common/shapes.c
</CD>

The fix I've applied works for your other example.  See attached. 

[chris']
Thanks, and yes it sounds convoluted and in need of a rewrite. It does tend
to happen in older systems, I deal with it all the time. Regarding ""code ...
repeated multiple times"", at my work we call these ""paste bombs"", because
they're made with the paste key, and they cause big problems later when some
of them get modified but others not.

I do have one question though. Is there an easier way to do what I'm trying
to do? All I want is to ensure that for each node, its inputs (edge heads)
connect on the top, and its outputs (edge tails) connect on the bottom.
Maybe there's already some dot feature I missed that adds this constraint?
Compass ports are overly constraining: I don't want to have specify
east/west, dot should keep that degree of freedom. Also compass ports won't
work if there are more than three edges connecting to the node top or
bottom.

If there's no such feature, perhaps I should propose it? The syntax is easy,
an edge could specify an orientation (TBLR) instead of a compass point, e.g.

edge1:B->edge2:T

or in a LR graph,

edge1:L->edge2:R

[erg]
I'm unclear as to what is being proposed. Is edge1 the name of a node, and B is short-hand for sw/s/se, whatever works?
Or is this a new keyword, and edge1:B specifies the previous constraint for all out-edges?

The original grammar did contain a specification for the angle an edge entered a node but, as with ports, it was never
implemented.  Presumably one might also want a fuzzy angle.

If the code can be simplified, great, but using ports affects mincross, positioning and edge routing, and everything has
to work correctly under the transformations used for rankdir.

[ellson]
My interpretation would be ""foonode:T -> ..."" means any that an outedge of foonode is constained to originate at any convenient angle from ne to nw.  Convenient to the edge layouter.""

Or, perhaps alternatively, that the edge induces a virtual port anywhere arout the node periphery between ne and nw.
<CD>

> The original grammar did contain a specification for the angle an edge entered a node but, as with ports, it was never
> implemented.  Presumably one might also want a fuzzy angle.
> </CD>

Yes, I think we are talking about fuzzy angles, or floating ports, with contrained flexibility left to the edge layouter.

[erg]
So

  foo:B -> bar:T

means that particular edge from foo to bar goes from the bottom of foo to the top of bar?

Note that we do have the port _ tells the router to use some reasonable port exposed to the outside of the node, so we already
have a notion of fuzziness.

The nice thing about having non-fuzzy ports is that this aids crossing reduction.

[chris]
Yes, exactly. For example in this case:
<CD>
alpha:B -> foo:T
bravo:B -> foo:T
charlie:B -> foo:T
delta:B -> foo:T
</CD>

all four edges would emanate from the bottom of their respective nodes, and
would terminate at the top of node foo. Ideally the edge heads would be
spaced evenly along the top of foo, and would appear in the same order that
they would have appeared if 'B' had not been specified.

L and R would exhibit the same behavior but horizontally, which would be
especially useful in a LR graph.

The fuzziness has advantages: the user avoids having to explicitly order the
edges, avoids special cases for different numbers of edges, and isn't
limited to three edges.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:16-04","2023-01-24 00:00:55.608-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

width to height ratio of roughly 1.45.

when we draw by dot's numbers, our shapes coincide?  This is particularly
crucial when we draw edges from triangles.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:48-04",NULL,"[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

We are using GraphViz to generate graphs. For interaction we parse the svg output.

For styling we use the <FONT></FONT> tags, tables, etc.

As the data comes from the user, we escape the input by replacing '&' with '&amp;', '<' with '&lt;' and '>' with '&gt;'.

To test this, I entered some HTML to make it as hard as possible for the graph to work. This leads to invalid SVG being generated.

It is hard to fix that for the input generator, as GraphViz is not consistent with how entities are handled:`'&amp;'` seems to get replaced with just '&' if this results in an entity definition in the output:`'&amp;lt;'` gives `'&lt;'` in the output. OTOH,`'&amp; foo'` results in `'&amp; foo'`.

It's hard to decide what is right here. I would have expected that dot would escape entities like it escapes tags if the input label is a plain string:

```
node [label=""<h1>""] -> <text>&lt;h1&gt;</text>         (okay in 2.27.0)
node [label=""&amp;""] -> <text>&amp;amp;</text>         (broken in 2.27.0, results in <text>&amp;</text>)
node [label=""&amp;nbsp;""]  -> <text>&amp;amp;nbsp;</text>  (broken in 2.27.0, results in <text>&nbsp;</text>)
```

When labels are given as HTML, behaviour should be different due to the input being XML-like already:

`node [label=<<h1>>]` -> should be an error, h1 is not according to http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html

`node [label=<&amp;bsp;>]` -> should result in `<text>&amp;bsp;</text>` (2.27.0: <text>&bsp;</text>)
`node [label=<&funny;>]` -> either error (funny is not a builtin XML entity) or `<text>&funny;</text>` (okay in 2.27.0)

I had a look at the sources and I know that this will be quite a bit of work. Sorry for the fuss, but I would deem this correct behaviour for GraphViz.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Process the following dot input:

```
digraph escape_xml {
        c [label=<<FONT POINT-SIZE=""48"">&amp;funny;</FONT>>]
}
```

`dot -Tsvg -o funny.svg funny.dot`

The resulting SVG output contains the following string:

`<text text-anchor=""start"" x=""8.5"" y=""-16.1"" font-family=""Times,serif"" font-size=""48.00"">&funny;</text>`

I would have expected the `&amp;` to be carried through from input to output.

This even happens if the input contains a simple string. Interestingly, stuff like `'&unknownent;'` is happily carried to the output.

The .dot included listed below runs fine; however if you uncomment the one commented node near the end dot segfaults pretty quickly.

PLATFORM: WINDOWS XP
## DESCRIPTION

I'm brand new to using Graphviz so apologies if some of this stuff is known.  But also, I found Graphviz cause I needed a circles-and-lines application, not because I'm trying to do anything fancy, or anything that requires a computer programmer.  

1) There's three items installed in the Start menu, none of which look like they belong there:  GVEDIT.EXE, SMYRNA.EXE, and a subfolder with a zillion ""Shortcut to..."" items with poor descriptions.   The first should be renamed to ""Graphviz"", the second doesn't even run and should be removed.  The third item should say ""Graphviz Help"" or something like that, and point to  C:\Program Files\GraphViz 2.28\share\graphviz\doc\html\index.html  which seems to be the real help file for this application. 

2) Said help file mentions many files that don't exist, and doesn't link to some help files that do exist and would be helpful for the typical Windows user.  Anything related to TCL doesn't exist, for example.  GVedit.HTML isn't mentioned and should be, for example.   I've attached an edited copy of index.html that comments out the missing items, and formats the long list into two columns to save on excessive scrolling.  It still isn't pretty, but it's an improvement. 

3) The HTML links to most of the PDF files are broken because their names in the folders have an extra dot and number in them, like acyclic.1.pdf instead of acyclic.pdf.  Not all links are broken in this way, but most of them are.  

4) Lots of files are included in the default installation that don't seem to need to be there except for programmers.  Also, there's an /etc/ subfolder whose 2 items, /fonts/ and /gtk-2.0/, are included again next to the same /etc/ folder.  Likely one set or the other could be deleted. 

5) .gv and .dot files aren't associated with the gvedit.exe program, or even have a descriptive name, like ""Graphviz document"" or somesuch. 

6) The default location that gvedit.exe saves and loads .gv or .dot files from is /bin/ rather than the user's My Documents folder.  

7) The open and save dialog boxes also want to load and save ""_._ any files"" rather than just the filetypes it knows about (.gv and .dot).   Combined with the above, it took me forever to figure out what kind of file I was supposed to open, and what happened to the one simple file I had made a week previous. 

8) The settings pane says ""layout engine"" with options like ""circo"", ""dot"", etc.,  rather than ""general layout"" with options ""circular"", ""heirarchy"", ""radial"", etc.  

9) The standard output file has no name, leading to multiple  files names  .png  all over my folders.   Please make a reasonable default output filename, such as  myplan.png  for the input file myplan.gv for example.

Reported By: Ryan Schmidt2

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2008-11-25 15:58:36

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.21
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

t seems like there's no way to turn off tooltips. Is that true or am I missing something?
<br>

The documentation says the default value for ""tooltip"" is the empty string [1], and that ""If unset, Graphviz will use the object's label if defined"" [2].
<br>

If I want no tooltips, it seems natural to say
<br>

node [tooltip=""""]
<br>

but that has no effect because that's the default. If I look at output from -Tcanon I see Graphviz even strips it out.
<br>

It would make more sense to me to define the default for ""tooltip"" as ""\L"" [3]. Remove the ""If unset..."" sentence from the tooltip definition. And thus let me set ""tooltip"" to the empty string to indicate that I want no tooltips.

This makes it harder to detect the install location of the latest version of GraphViz.

<br>

I've tried to install Graphviz (to be used together with Doxygen) on
my 64-bit Vista machine. According to the installation process the
installation seems to be OK. I can start dotty and GVedit from the
Programs menu. The strange thing is that the programs are installed in
the root directory of my E drive (E:\ contains now bin, lib, etc,
include and share sub directories), although I specified the default
path in the installation GUI.
Why is the package installed on the E drive ?
Doxygen does not recognize / cannot find the dot tool, although its
path is explicitly specified in the Doxyfile.
<br>

On an other machine without an E drive the installation is OK, and works
together with Doxygen.

## DESCRIPTION

Hi,

I have a reasonably-sized graph (number of nodes is a couple thousands at most) that ""overflows"" the layout algorithm.

Some of the clusters are given funny bounding boxes and overlap one another. In turn, nodes that were supposed to be inside those clusters are in ""free-roam"" mode.

I attached the .dot graph to this message so that you could give it a try and see for yourself.

I have used both ""gvLayout()"" in my program and ""dot -Tps vgate3.adl.out.xml.dot -o vgate3.ps"". Both output similar results.

I am using graphviz_2.26.3-5_amd64.deb.
I am also aware that the latest stable release is 2.28, but I couldn't get around to solving the dependencies.

Thankyou for your help.

Xavier
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

> > dot -Tps vgate3.adl.out.xml.dot -o vgate3.ps
> > evince vgate3.ps

or

call gvLayout() from the C library

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
Related to bug 2048. As with that bug, it is only necessary to 
run dot on the generated <A HREF=""b2069.gv"">graph</A>.

Also note that creating a subgraph in the root graph and then
inserting it into another subgraph causes the output graph to
contain two copies of a subgraph. I'm not sure this is a good idea.
The parser actually warns about this, because it can cause strange
behavior, especially if the subgraphs are clusters.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:04:09-04","2020-07-26 00:06:41.787-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

So the abort is in shortest.c(growdq) when malloc fails. What irritates me
is that the message from perror doesn't seem to be printed.
<br>

Question now is if this is a bug in dot or is there just not enough memory
available (x86-64 aka AMD64 with 3 GiB Memory).
<br>

As told in the report, it's pgram.dot from the graphviz examples.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] I am unable to reproduce this on our Linux server with version 2.25. Maybe John can get it
to fail.

In any case, the bug is very strange, in that the input graph is small and the call to malloc
only occurs on the first call of growdq, in which case, it asks for 96 bytes. So memory
should not be an issue.

dot -Tpng graph.g > graph.png
dot -Tpng graph.g > graph.jpg
wkoszek@wkoszek-laptop:~/r/papers/fpga_articles/0_FPGA_Intro$
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Dotty's version:

wkoszek@wkoszek-laptop:~/r/papers/fpga_articles/0_FPGA_Intro$ dotty -V dotty version 96c (09-24-96) lefty version 10 Mar 2005 graphviz version 2.20.2 (Tue Mar 2 21:46:26 UTC 2010)

[erg] I'm not sure you sent the correct input graph. The error message from dotty reports

> graph parser: syntax error near line 19
> context:  >>> SDK <<<  Intro:

but the input graph contains nothing like SDK or Intro. So it is hard for me to make any particular suggestions.

However, the 2.20 version of Graphviz is almost 3 years old, and we have made various fixes to dotty during that time, so you should probably update your version and try again.

Finally, we hope to have the 2.28 release out shortly. Dotty will still be in that release, but its use is deprecated. It still has many quirks, and its author probably won't be making any significant changes. We recommend using the gvedit program instead.

[koszek] I have installed whatever Ubuntu has in its package collection. No idea why it's so old - my system is being updated on a regular basis.

I have just submited file which dotty reported as buggy. This is the file that comes from the bug report printed by dotty.

The original file ""graph.g"", which I use like that:

```
wkoszek@wkoszek-laptop:~/r/papers/fpga_articles/0_FPGA_Intro$ cat
graph.g | /usr/bin/dotty -
graph parser: syntax error near line 19

dotty.lefty: to fail has been saved in file dottybug.dot
dotty.lefty: please fill out a bug report at
dotty.lefty: http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/bugform.html
```

Is below:

digraph test123 {
        rankdir=LR;
        bgcolor=black;
        edge [
                color=orange

        node [

If you need anything else, let me know.

That is up to the people who maintain the Ubuntu packages. You might want to ask for them to update the software.

My problem is that dotty is reporting a syntax error in the input it receives. In particular, it is reporting that somewhere around line 19, it is seeing the text ""SDK Intro:"". But your input graph does not contain those words.

What happens if you don't cat the file but just run

dotty graph.g

? Can you send me the file dottybug.dot that dotty produces?

[koszek] Same error. I know it doesn't make sense. I know there's no ""SDK"" anywhere there. But the ""dottybug.dot"" which you ask me about below is what I have submitted in a bug report.

So you should have thisfile already.

The file which I pasted in the e-mail is a input file which I either send through pipe to dotty, or which I use as ""dotty graph.g"".

Just try to repaste it in your file and see if your dotty produces the same bug. If it doesn't it might be just my old dotty's version.

[erg]

No, dotty works fine for me.

One possibility is that dotty, as a shell script, causes a shell program to be created, and sometimes this produces output which gets read by dotty. See

  http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/b549.html

This same problem has arisen multiple times.

Beyond that, I have no idea what to recommend beyond building your own copy of graphviz or getting the ubuntu people to update the package.

[koszek] Thanks for help. Will try to solve this problem on my own. Wanted to exclude software's fault.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hi,
<br>

eddy@opera.com has reported the following bug to the debian BTS
(#620801) ...
<br>

I'm making a digraph showing state-transitions for the terrain in
freeciv; a simple dot file has done very nicely for the transitions
between states; irrigation (blue arcs) turns forest into plains, mining
converts back, etc.  When I try to add arcs indicating 'internal' state
transitions - irrigating hills doesn't change the fact that they're
hills but does improve their food output - I run up against a limitation
on the placement of text on such self-arrows.
<br>

By default, all the self-arrows come out on the right; when there are
several on a node, each self-edge's loop goes round the last one's label
and nodes are moved apart enough to make room for these edges and
labels.  This is all readable but aesthetically messy; it would look
nicer if self-edges protruded in different directions so as not to push
one another further from the node to which they relate.  I can set the
headport and tailport to move the edges around, but it turns out that
the placement of their text labels is then messed up.
<br>

If I put an edge :nw->:nw or :sw->:sw, its text gets placed exactly as
if the edge were :w->:w (and in a position sensible for this port but
not for nw or sw).  So I can only put one label (hence one edge) on the
left.  Fortunately (!) this is asymmetric: :se->:se and :ne->:ne are
placed differently than one another and :e->:e (the default).
<br>

Sadly, however, even then I see a more severe problem, also present for
the left-side self-loops: node, edge and label positions are not
adjusted to make space for the labels of non-default-port self-loops.
<br>

While I may be able to concoct some abomination of a way to stretch
labelangle and labeldistance to work round this, the default clearly
does take account of label texts when placing the rest of the graph and
its labels, so it's a shame that setting an edge's ports breaks that.
Example small dot file [see below] showing all symptoms described above:
<br>

Note that the graph-drawing _does_ take account of the self-edges, it's
only the labels that are left out of consideration; and the :e->:e
edge's label, unlike all others, _is_ correctly provided for (delete its
line to see Left and Right move closer together, causing West to overlap
Left instead of East), even when its ports are specified explicitly as
:e (where the default isn't actually representable by specifying port;
it's sort of :ene->ese; remove the :e specifiers to see the edge loop
open up a bit without the nodes or labels moving).
<br>

Some of the problems are alleviated if I use different ports for head
and tail; but, even then, some label texts overlap other label texts.
<br>

I normally emit the image as SVG using
/usr/bin/dot -Tsvg
(automated by a .htaccess hack and a cgi-bin script in my local
web-server) but see exactly the same result when running dot -Tpng
manually.  (For my reference:
http://vortex/~eddy/img/misc/graphviz-label-placement-bug.dot
is my local copy.)

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

My goal is to use some code in Matlab (someone else's code) that
calls 'neato' - which looks like a really cool piece of software,
by the way. I have problems installing GraphViz on RHEL5 (some
similar issues on RHEL6, too - possibly related). I have looked
through the previous bugs on this, and they were helpful, but they
did not ultimately solve the problem.
<br>

<br>

Installing GraphViz via yum has all kinds of dependency errors. But
then this version works fine:
<CD>

> > []# yum install 'graphviz*' -x graphviz-php
> >   (thanks to bug1913 for that one).
> > </CD>
> > <br>

So I figure the problem is with PHP and I don't care - except that
it turns out the Matlab call to 'neato/dot' fails. Here are the errors
I get when I try to install just the problem package:

So the questions I hope you might help me with are:
1. Is 'graphviz-php' usually required for the Matlab interface?
2. Any idea where this dependency hell for graphviz-php is headed?
3. Any smart work-arounds that I've missed here?
   </CD>
   <br>

Thanks very much for your help!

Scott.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north]
Scott, sorry for the problems.

Why install graphviz-php?  If Matlab just calls neato as
an executable program, you just need basic graphviz.

What repository are you pointing to?

The dependency nightmares are particularly severe with
the swig interfaces because they touch all the specific
interpreters (which of course can come in both stable
and devel releases themselves).  A separate issue is
that we also build on top of a bunch of graphics drivers
including pango, cairo, fontconfig, freetype, gd2, png,
zlib; we also now have a qt4 based editor. 

Open source is an interesting software development
methodology isn't it.  The bazzar is neat but no one
can build anything taller than one story.

[ellson]
It sounds like you might have a previous installation of graphviz-php ?

Try:
<CD>
    rpm -e graphviz-php
    yum update 'graphviz*'

Thanks for your help. Actually, I've done a clean install and there's no old graphviz-php hanging around. 

One weird thing, though. If I: 
<CD>
  []# yum info 'graphviz*' 
</CD>

I get version numbers such as 2.26.3 for almost all components EXCEPT for graphviz-php which gives me an older version number (2.16). Is this as it ought to be? Here's the full printout for yum info graphviz-php:

<CD>
Backslash sequences in the input intended for display are not

\t, dot.exe renders this as a single backslash and a t, while 
dotty.exe renders the t but not the backslash. Changing the input 
to \\t makes dotty.exe render a single backslash.

The dotty program apparently does its own additional handling of escape sequences, thereby causing the
discrepancy. It is not clear when (or if) this will get fixed. The next release will contain gvedit, which
should act as a reasonable dotty replacement, although at present it doesn't handle node and edge creation

2.22?  2009?   did you try a newer one?
otherwise we will have to wait for the invention of time
travel to go back to 2009 to correct the old version

[david]
Sorry, I'm at work on machines I don't have install priviliges for.
I'll try on a more recent one on my Mac when I get home. 

[north]
If they installed devel packages on your machine you can build graphviz yourself.

Even if they didn't you can build local copies of all those libraries (I used to anyway)
but it's a bit time consuming.  But the computer has a lot of free time so it's just running
autogen/configure and make install about 10 times.

[david]
When I try with a newer version:

twopi - graphviz version 2.26.3 (20100126.1600)

It doesn't crash, but the resulting graph (atteched <A HREF=""b2150.pdf"">pdf</A>) is incomplete:
The root node **TOP** is missing entirely.
What does anyone else get? 

[erg]
I can't reproduce the exact problem, but I do hit an assertion failure.

As a workaround, try changing overlap=false to overlap=prism.

It appears using overlap=false causes the node xs to be given the position
(nan,nan), but only if the node xs_xb is a box.

overlap=prsim isn't supported in 2.22.x (work machine)

VERSION: CVS-20110313
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Using dot via the gv python module, I see a number of segfaults.
I traced the calls to the gv library and the attached file reproduces the problem:
<CD>
torsten@sharokan:~$ valgrind lua gvtrace.lua
==19073== Memcheck, a memory error detector

==19073== ERROR SUMMARY: 18 errors from 14 contexts (suppressed: 43 from 7)
<br>

When using neato instead of dot, there are no errors reported by valgrind.
This seems to get triggered by removing nodes from the graph. Keeping
the nodes also makes the problem go away.
<br>

Here is the backtrace for the first duplicate free:

</CD>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
Before doing another layout, you need to call gvFreeLayout() to free the memory used in the first layout.
As it says in section 2.4 of the library manual:

<CD>

> A given graph can be laid out multiple times. The application, however, must clean up the earlier
> layout's information with a call to gvFreeLayout before invoking a new layout function.
> </CD>

Please try this and see if the leak goes away. If you are still seeing leaks, let us know. By the way, there
is a known leak relating to dot and clusters. 

[torsten]
sorry for not coming back to you earlier. I forgot what I supplied with
the bug report and wanted to reply as soon as it goes online. I only
noticed today that the report is now available at

http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/b2149.html

The bug form has the real draw back that the submitter does not get a
copy of the report which I would have expected.

<CD>

> > Please try this and see if the leak goes away. If you are still seeing 
> > </CD>
> > Sorry to tell you but I can't. I am using the Python wrappers to drive
> > GraphViz. The wrapper API does not expose the gvFreeLayout function.

In fact, all what I can call is the layout function in tclpkg/gv/gv.cpp
which has the following source code:

bool layout(Agraph_t *g, const char *engine)
{
    int err;

```
if (!g)
    return false;
err = gvFreeLayout(gvc, g);  /* ignore errors */
err = gvLayout(gvc, g, engine);
return (! err);
```

}

AFAICT this should be fine as gvFreeLayout is called before doing a new
layout. Note especially that the problem I was reporting is actually
inside a call of gvFreeLayout:

(gdb) where
#0  0x000000000b3414c5 in free_virtual_node_list (vn=0x5af31a0) at dotinit.c:128
#1  0x000000000b3416fd in dot_cleanup (g=0x5af03a0) at dotinit.c:176
#2  0x00000000060fe149 in gvFreeLayout (gvc=0x5addf00, g=0x5af03a0) at gvlayout.c:110
#3  0x0000000005ec1f1a in layout (g=0x5af03a0, engine=0x5acc458 ""dot"") at gv.cpp:881

So your suggestiong to call gvFreeLayout does not help in any way as
this is where the problem occurrs.

I just updated to the current CVS version of GraphViz and this is what I
get out of valgrind:

The traceback is still the same. It seems like removing a node somehow

<br>

dot.exe is missing from the file graphviz-bin-2.27.20110207.0545.zip and
so graphviz doesn't run and can't generate graph (we _could_ create
graphs with lneato or some other, if present, but dot is the most
used/useful one).

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When I save my text file to update the edges graphviz crashes.
<br>

The code that seems to cause it is the following:
<br>
## <CD>

```
Pallidum[label = <
   <TABLE BORDER=""0"" CELLBORDER=""1"" CELLSPACING=""10"" CELLPADDING=""8"" >
     <TR>
        <TD ROWSPAN=""3"" PORT=""GPi"">GPi</TD>
        <TD ROWSPAN=""3"" PORT=""GPe"">GPe</TD>
        <TD ROWSPAN=""3"" PORT=""Ventral_Pallidum"">Ventral Pallidum</TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>>  ];
```

<br>

```
subgraph clusterBG { Striatum;
                     Substantia_Nigra;
                     Pallidum;
                     Striatuma;
                     STN;
                     [label = ""BG""]
}
```

---

</CD>
It will not crash if I remove the ""Pallidum"" from the subgraph ""clusterBG""
<br>

The file runs fine if a friend of mine runs it on a linux comp (version 2.27).
<br>

So first thought it was a version error and updated to 2.27 for mac but still got the same crash
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
The input graph is not legal dot. For example, you have
<CD>

```
subgraph clusterBG      {   Striatum;
                    Substantia_Nigra; 
                    Pallidum;
                    Striatuma; 
                    STN; 
                        [label = ""BG""] 
                }
```

</CD>

Assuming the label is meant for the cluster, there shouldn't be
any square brackets around it.

If you run /usr/local/bin/dot on your graph, you'll get error messages,
but apparently the Graphviz.app accepts this.

<A HREF=""b2130a.gv"">Here</A> is a cleaned-up version.

To clarify, are you saying that you start Graphviz.app on your graph,
then use File -> Export, and then the crash occurs?

When I try, using both the original graph and a corrected version,
everything is fine on Leopard, but on Snow Leopard, both cause
Graphviz to crash. However, /usr/local/bin/dot works fine on the
corrected input.

[max]
Hi Emden, for starters thanks for looking into it. Regarding you question, graphviz crashes when it tries to load the .gv file either via export or when it is alreadu open and i save the updated file via text editor. It also crashes when opening the .gv file via the finder.
About the label part, i doubt that that is really the problem since the other three subgraph clusters with a label work fine. Instead of it being something to do with the code it self it seems to be an issue of snowleopard and graphviz interacting.. Since the same code runs on linux and leopard without issues but crashes on two seperate computers bith running snowleopard.
Any other ideas are welcom!

[erg]
I agree about the label, since I get the crash from a graph with correct
syntax. Unfortunately, running /usr/local/bin/dot on the graph works fine,
so I have no idea how to start debugging this. With luck, Glen will be
able to give it a look.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

We have mantis installed including graphviz.
Now we wanted to include a Wysiwyg editor to have a bit more sophisticated output.
However after loading the javascript, the graphs stop working, no error message but the output is the simple red cross.
I have tried several editors, Xinha Ckeditor Nicedit, all have the same effect.
Any idea what is causing this behaviour?
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] I have no idea, especially because I don't know how graphviz is being integrated into mantis, or
how the wysiwyg editor fits in. If graphviz is hanging, it could be something as simple as a buffer
not being flushed. But any reasonable conjecture would depend on knowing the system architecture.

You will probably have better luck contacting the people doing mantis.

Installing graphviz-2.26.3.msi on a Dell Vostro with Windows XP Pro,
it made some progress, then the progress bars ran backward.
Installation displayed a message saying it was interrupted.
Program Files/Graphviz2.26 had been removed.

I tried the workaround, running msiexec.  This did not add anything
in the start menu, and Add/Remove programs did not show Graphviz
as installed.  I could run GVEdit but not dotty.

Checking dependencies of dot.exe, MSVCR80.dll was missing.
I noticed versions of this were shipped in Graphviz-2.26/Windows,
but apparently not installed successfully.

Before installing Graphviz, Visual C++ 6.0 was installed,
so older runtime libraries were in Windows/system32, i.e. MSVCR71.dll

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
It's not so much a crash as that dot exits prematurely because
the input file is not utf-8. Setting charset=latin1 fixes this.
However, dotty doesn't handle non-ascii characters, so this is more
of a modification request than a bug.

dotty is a very old program, and wasn't ever updated to use non-ASCII character sets.
So it won't work with your file. It probably won't ever be updated (though anyone is
welcome to try). We should probably remove it from the package. There are 
probably we should remove it from the graphviz disrtibution. You might do better
with a more modern front end -- the choice depends on your operating system.

The input character set is Latin-1, not the default UTF-8. Run dot with the -Gcharset=latin1 flag, or convert the input to UTF-8.
I don't know why you didn't see any error message.

Thanks for the reply sir. Actually what i got is just the dot.exe is executing the dot file without stoping it's hang up for me. Can you run the attached dot file and see why its happening like this please. Please tell me the way to correct this please.

[erg]
If you run dot.exe with the -Gcharset=latin1 flag, does it still hang?

[ganesh]
Yes still its hang :( . Please give some solution for me.

[erg]
Sorry for the delay. I checked this on a Windows XP machine, but I wanted to also check on a Windows 7 machine.

In both cases, if you run dot on your graph, an error message is printed in the console window, and it exits with no output.
If  you add the -Gcharset=latin1 flag, dot runs and exits with no error and produces the expected output. So, we are
unable to replicate your problem and have no idea what is happening.

Does dot work on other graphs? What happens if you run dot with the -v flag? What does you get when you run dot -V?
What is the exact command line  you use, and from what shell?

So my command line is "" -Tcmap -omy_test.map -Tgif -omy_test.gif my_test.dot"" . Im not well know about the dot file and command line for that, So please help me on this sir what is the syntax for ""-Gcharset=latin1"" setting this flag sir.

For me other dot files are working fine without any issue. Im also dont know the syntax of -V flag sir :( . Please help me to comeout from this issue sir.

[erg]

I am unfamiliar with the use of c#.net, but it would be helpful to get it out of the way.

Try using gvEdit on your file. Or, better, start a DOS shell and run the dot command from there,
using all of your flags.

  C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.26.3\bin\dot.exe -Tcmap -omy_test.map -Tgif -omy_test.gif my_test.dot

and see if that hangs. If it does, then something is wrong in dot. If not, then the hanging is related
to the c#.net usage.

Command-line flags are just parameters starting with -. For example, -Tcmap and -omy_test.gif are
flags. Thus, to use ""-Gcharset=latin1"", just add it somewhere in the command line:

  C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.26.3\bin\dot.exe -Gcharset=latin1 -Tcmap -omy_test.map -Tgif -omy_test.gif my_test.dot

or, since the -G flag just sets a graph attribute, you can add the line

  charset=latin1

to your input graph.

Similarly, to use the -v flag, just run

  C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.26.3\bin\dot.exe -v -Gcharset=latin1 -Tcmap -omy_test.map -Tgif -omy_test.gif my_test.dot

You can use the -V flag the same way, but that appears unnecessary, as it is pretty clear your are indeed running
the 2.26 version.

You didn't include any of this information about c# or the extra flags in your bug report, so we didn't use them in
our tests. We'll try to replicate the problem using the added flags. Perhaps they induce the problem. 

[ganesh]
I was tested using DOS command itself. Same issue exists there also. Actually, an error is in dot file only that's for sure. However, I'm not exactly found which line of the dot file is causing this issue. I run the dot file using ""-Gcharset=latin1"" and ""-V"" flag. I got some message in the command window. I attached that <A HREF=""b2101.png"">screenshot </A> with this mail, please look into that and let me know I did any wrong.  Still its hangs it seems :( . I attached the <A HREF=""b2101a.gv"">dot file</A> too, please have a look on this and let me know if any mistake I did. Thanks a lot sir.

Although I didn't interrupt anything... I tried 3 times, each time same

I agree it's more a msi-related bug, but could it be possible to get only

myself, and add needed OS integration.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I initially loaded graphviz on WinXP and have been running this command without a problem:
dot -Tps -Gsize=17.0,11.0 -o ant_website.ps ant_website.dot
<br>

When I tried the same thing on Vista, then later upgraded my OS to Win7,
 it always fails with this error:
<br>

(dot.exe:10080): Pango-WARNING **: couldn't load font ""Times Bold Not-Rotated 12"", falling back to ""Sans Bold Not-Rotated 12"", expect ugly output.
<br>

That makes my output file wrong so I have marked this as a ""major"" issue in severity.
<br>

Things I have tried:
<CD>
(1) Found bug 1634 that sounds like the same issue, but it did not resolve it.
(2) Found bug 1246 that also sounds the same and suggests that going back to 2.12 should get rid of the error.
Where could I get the earlier version?
(3) In April 2010 I corresponded with Arif who suggested this:
""Graphviz uses fontconfig library to look up font files and fontconfig has a config file ""fonts.conf"" that needs
to be modified to point windows font directory, if you locate that file and add your fonts directory in it, i am sure you would get rid of the warnings.""
I tried that but no luck. Attempting to get further info from Arif was also unsuccessful.

If the coordinates are changed to make the drawing a tad smaller, the image re-appears. I'm
guessing that cairo or our plugin must assume the scaled down image is too small and optimizes
it out.

I know you said you checked, but something has to be different in the
three environments.

Environment variables?   Userid?  Permissions?   NFS automounts? ... ?

Are you using dot in a webserver environment?    If so, what userid is
running dot when in the webserver?  Does that userid have sufficient
permissions to access font caches?

If you run ""trace dot ...""   (strace? truss?) can you see roughly what
its doing when it hangs for 12 seconds?

[michael]
Ok thanks,
I will have a look again.
I'm pretty sure it's the same...
Never knows....

[michael]
Sorry for the delay,

I have double-checked permissions and variables. It's Ok.
For the NFS automounts, i cant say, but I will ask the Solaris team.

Dot is used from a webserver. The userid has enough permissions to access font caches...

As I'm not the system admin of the Solaris server, I'm not familiar with the trace dot...... But the trace command is not found in my environement.
I just found that the fc-cache service was not launch on the environement where graphviz is really slow. But I also found that it is not launched either on another server where graphviz works really fast...

Sorry but i'm stuck. 
Any help is welcome.

I am using the graphviz package that comes with SUSE.
When I use neato, if I set splines = true (or polyline or ortho), the edges and edge labels will overlap with each other.
Although the problem disappears when i set splines = false (or line), I need splines = true for my work.
Could you please have a look?  Thanks.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
The 2.26 neato handles multiedges. Any chance you are picking up an
older version of neato? What do you get when you run neato -V?

[hong]
I can get this figure if I set splines = false/line.  But not for
true/polyline/ortho.

I get ""neato - graphviz version 2.26.3 (2010126.1600)"".

[erg]
Then the only other explanation I can think of is that SUSE graphviz
is being built without the GTS triangulation library, which is required to
generate multiedges for splines. If that is the case, you won't
have the prism overlap removal either. You can check this by
running neato on a graph that produces overlapping nodes and using
-Goverlap=prism. You should get a warning that prism is unknown.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:08:11-04","2021-05-30 00:06:55.409-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Dot loops forever during spline routing with the attached file.
<br>

Problem can be mitigated by:
<CD>
- setting ranksep to equally
- replacing spline routing by line routing
- deleting one of the following transitions :
              confirmationMotif->blocRelance [label=""33%""];
              analyseMotif->blocRelance [label=""12%""];
  </CD>
  <br>

However, I feel the spline router should not try forever. It should rather fail nicely, or produce an approximate solution.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
The problem is that the flat, labeled edge relancePanne->invitLN has a very thin top box above the
label. The path algorithm returns a spline lying outside of the boxes, never going through the top box,
so the attempt to trim the the boxes to the space used by the spline always fails for the top box.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hello,
<br>

the generated SVG markup has two problems.
<br>

First, it's verbose because it has comments for every node and edge.
Example:

```
<CD>
<!-- 802967 -->
<g id=""node1"" class=""node""><title>802967</title>
<ellipse fill=""none"" stroke=""black"" cx=""3757"" cy=""-3210"" rx=""38.2368"" ry=""18""/>
<text text-anchor=""middle"" x=""3757"" y=""-3205.4"" font-family=""Times New Roman,serif"" font-size=""14.00"">802967</text>
</g>
<!-- 111975 -->
<g id=""node3"" class=""node""><title>111975</title>
<ellipse fill=""none"" stroke=""black"" cx=""3230"" cy=""-3138"" rx=""38.2368"" ry=""18""/>
<text text-anchor=""middle"" x=""3230"" y=""-3133.4"" font-family=""Times New Roman,serif"" font-size=""14.00"">111975</text>
</g>
<!-- 802967&#45;&gt;111975 -->
<g id=""edge2"" class=""edge""><title>802967&#45;&gt;111975</title>
<a xlink:title=""802967 vs 111975&#10;1 matches&#10;Wins: 1&#8211;0"">
<path fill=""none"" stroke=""black"" d=""M3718.78,-3208.98C3636.74,-3206.08 3438.12,-3195.24 3277,-3156 3274.04,-3155.28 3271.01,-3154.42 3267.99,-3153.47""/>
<polygon fill=""black"" stroke=""black"" points=""3269.06,-3150.14 3258.46,-3150.22 3266.8,-3156.77 3269.06,-3150.14""/>
</a>
<a xlink:title=""1 wins for 802967 over 111975"">
<text text-anchor=""middle"" x=""3709.55"" y=""-3208.24"" font-family=""Times New Roman,serif"" font-size=""14.00"">1</text>
</a>
</g>
</CD>
```

<br>

The comments are useless and only bloat document size. They should be removed.
<br>

Second, the markup uses non-accessable elements for tooltips.
When you do not specify tooltips (with the attributes tooltip, headtooltip or tailtooltip) in your dot file,
it's ok to generate <title></title> elements for each node and edge as it is done now.
But when you specify tooltips these title elements should instead contain the tooltip content.
At the moment a new <a xlink:title=""...""> gets included which is not the proper way for tooltips.
See also http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DescriptionAndTitleElements
In fact WebKit is the only browser layout engine which understands xlink:title (but still uses <title></title> when there's no xlink:title).
Gecko (Firefox) and Presto (Opera) display the <title></title> content for tooltips.
So changing it would make it work for all browsers.
<br>

Comments are not useless, and don't add that much to the size. There must be tools that will filter out
comments.

Well, this is a problem. I agree that the svg spec says:

<CD>
  In general it is preferable to use a `title' child element rather than a`title' attribute.
</CD>

On the other hand, I find that, as you say, Opera ignores xlink:title but uses`<title></title>`, but Firefox
uses xlink:title and ignores `<title></title>`. (Safari uses `xlink:title` but if it is not there, it falls back to
`<title></title>`.)

I suppose one solution would be to put the tooltip in both.

[tobias]
I think you misunderstood my report concerning comments.
Comments are indeed not useless but I was referring to the comments that are
auto-generated without specifying a comment attribute in dot.
These should not be included. Furthermore, specified comments in dot are
mapped to additional SVG comments with <!-- -->. 
I suggest to map them to <desc></desc> elements which is there for exactly
such use cases.

You are right that Firefox 3.6 uses xlink:title and ignores <title></title>.
I was testing with Firefox 4 which uses <title></title>.
So yes, the best solution would be to put the tooltip in both at the moment.

One more thing. I wondered why the dash character (-) is nonsensically
escaped into a Unicode character reference (&#45;) everywhere in SVG.
I found the problem in the source code. In file labels.c line 479 to 482:

```
<CD>
else if (*s == '-') {   /* can't be used in xml comment strings */
        sub = ""&#45;"";
        len = 5;
}
</CD>
```

Dash can be used in XML and it doesn't belong to the XML entities to be
escaped `(<,>,&,"",')`. But some dash-combinations may not be used in comments
only. 

""For Compatibility, the string ""--"" (double-hyphen) MUST NOT occur within
comments. Parameter entity references MUST NOT be recognized within
comments.
Note that the grammar does not allow a comment ending in --->. The following
example is not well-formed.
`<!-- B+, B, or B--->`""
http://www.stylusstudio.com/w3c/xml11/sec-comments.htm

So this is a bit tricky. I propose to add a parameter like ""iscomment"" to
the xml_string() function. So dashes get only escaped in comments and
`<,>,&,"",'`do not get escaped there. This would allow ""-"" inside IDs etc.

Anyway, as stated above I would remove these system-comments away and put
user-comments inside `<desc></desc>`.

The code could be altered to make the use of node/edge comments an option, with an
attribute or -Tsvg-no-comment, but it doesn't seem worth it.

[erg]
 This actually qualifies as a request for a new feature. At present, only fdp supports the
notion of compound graphs, where an edge can connect to a cluster.

dot provides a hack that often gives you what you want. You set compound=true. All of the
edges still go from nodes to nodes, but an edge can specify a cluster as a logical head and tail,
to the edge drawing is clipped in the appropriate way. Obviously, you need to specify which are
the nodes actually used for the edges, and it does not allow nested clusters to have such edges.

For example, for your graph, try

<CD>
digraph G {
    compound=true
    n1->n2
    subgraph cluster_A {
        n1
        n2
    }

    subgraph cluster_B {
        n3
        n4

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm trying to draw a state machine using dot.  I was using Visio but
would prefer not to waste time arranging nodes and drawing primitives.
<br>

Some of my labels are rather long, and get jumbled up either against
shapes or over each other.  The result is pretty hard to read.
<br>

It would be nice if:
<br>

1) There were a way to place labels right over edges, perhaps with a
solid white background to clear the way for the text
<br>

2) The routing strategy incorporated the size of the label, so that the
label isn't just pasted on over whatever happens to be there.
<br>

Sweet tool though!
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[arif]
Edge labeling is not Graphviz' best strength.
A work around could  be defining those edge labels as nodes and set node border color to white.

[erg]
Actually, dot does do 2). Each edge label is treated as a dummy node and allocated its own
space, away from any node or other edge label. What you are seeing here is a real bug, in which
one edge label is being assigned the same position as another.

The bug is related to the warning you should be seeing. At present, dot does not allow a node
to be constrained twice by subgraphs. In your input, you place s5 in cluster W and also say that
S5 and sX0 to have the same rank. You only get to choose one. If you comment out
<CD>
  {
    rank = same;
    s5; sX0;
  }
</CD>

the problem goes away. You still need to decide if you want sX0 in cluster X or not.

Concerning 1), we are working on providing a post-processing labeling feature. This will be 
helpful in certain cases, but as space isn't allocated, it may fail with very large labels.
Also, if you use HTML-like labels for the edges, you can arrange to have the label text drawn
on a white rectangle.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:02:57-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I have a digraph that renders fine.  The nodes are rectangles with
HTML tables, so that each node has an image on the first table row and
a caption on the second table row.
<br>

I want to make it landscape, so I specify rotate=90.  The graph and HTML
tables rotate, but the images in the tables are pasted off to the right
of the drawing without rotation.
<br>

I suppose there's a chance that this is a bug in Mozilla, but I can't
tell from the outside.  I ended up pasting the drawing into Visio and
rotating it there.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

You have to supply the images, but it doesn't seem to matter what
images you use.  This works fine if rotate is not specified.

```
digraph G
{
  rotate = 90;
  n0 [shape=box, label =<<table border=""0""><tr><td><img src=""00.png"" scale=""both""></img></td></tr>
                                          <tr><td>Caption 0</td></tr></table>>];
  n1 [shape=box, label =<<table border=""0""><tr><td><img src=""9A.png"" scale=""both""></img></td></tr>

[erg]
Does the snippet of the graph you sent with the bug report cause the problem if you run dot on it?
If not, where might we find the full graph? Also, can you supply the command line flags you used, or
tell us how ran dot? Thanks.

[len]
Yes, that snippet reliably causes the crash.  I tried to remove as much of the file as possible to try to make isolating the cause easier.  It works ok if you comment out the ""nodesep=5"" in that file.

I'm not running DOT explicitly;  I'm using GVedit v:1.01 and its ""run"" button to create a JPG file.  I'm not putting any additional attributes in the ""Graphiz Settings"" window.

-- Len

PS: Despite its quirkiness, I love this program!  As you might guess, we're using it to mock up a chart of programming language history for an exhibit at the Computer History Museum, www.computerhistory.org.

[erg]
We'll check this using GVedit and dot on Windows. Meanwhile, if I had to guess, I suspect it relates to producing a very large bitmap.
The final graph is about 350 inches wide by 88 inches high. Unless you really need a bitmap of that size, you might consider using
the size attribute to scale it down, or produce non-bitmap output such as SVG.

[len]
I will scale it down.  We do ultimately want a chart about 4' high by 15' wide, but I haven't been paying attention to the bitmap size while working on the content and previewing it on the screen.  And I'll look into non-bitmap formats, which our production crew probably know how to handle when it comes time to print.

[arif]
It is a pango issue.
-Tjpg:gd works fine

Indeed it does, thanks!

<br>

I would like to have two lines in a tooltip of a node.
E.g. when I hover my mouse over a node named A, it will show the following tooltip:
<CD>

```
-----------------
the first line
the second line
-----------------
```

But it doesn't work for using ""\n"".  Here is the code:
<br>

<CD>

```
graph G {
A [tooltip=""the first line \n the second line""]
}
```

</CD>
<br>

I have tried to replace \n with &#13;, but it doesn't work.
However, if i replace \n with &#33;, it successfully shows the ! character.
Hence, I wonder if it is a bug for not allowing `&#13;` or graphviz simply doesn't support multiline tooltip.

In addition, is there any way for me to have multiline in tooltip?  Thanks.

```
graph G {
A [tooltip=""the first line \n the second line""]

Please support start position for child nodes in twopi. As can be seen in attached example, the first child node is always placed North to North-East of the center node.
<br>

The rankdir could be used to this to rotate the positioning of all child nodes by 90, 180 and 270 degrees compared to the default situation as is existing already. The rankdir is by default TB (top to bottom) which suits the current positioning. BT (bottom to top) can be used for 180 degreed rotation of he placement and LR for 270 degrees and RL for 90 degrees.
<br>

The nodes are always placed in a clockwise order. There is no need to have an option for this, since defining the graph in reverse order results in reverse (counter clockwise) order.
<br>

All possibilities are documented in the attachment too.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hello,
<br>

I'm opening this bug because I noticed libgraph is using char\* pretty much everywhere in it's function signatures, even when const char\* (static strings) are expected.
<br>

This is completely transparent in C, but with a modern C++ compiler, it triggers compilation warnings about const char\* being given to the functions instead of char\* if using static strings.
<br>

Since the functions seem to expect static strings and do not seem to modify them, I think they should use const char\* instead.
<br>

Cordially,
SD.

I just downloaded the current stable version and the development snapshot to create a simple

<br>

Reproduce:
<CD>
1. Start Graphviz
2. Click Cancel in the 'Open' Dialog (as you don't have a document yet.
</CD>
<br>

Result:
What now? There is no empty document opened for you nor is there a 'New' Tab in the
file menu.
<br>

Expected Result:
Easy way to create a new document.
<br>

I also tried this:
<CD>
1. Create empty file (something.dot)
2. Open document in Graphiviz
Result:
Graphviz Crashes
Expected Result:
Graphviz shows an empty Document the can be edited.
</CD>
<br>

Maybe I'm just too fast asleep or too stupid to catch my error. But neither the
Application nor the Documentation does gives any clue to a new user here.

VERSION: 2.26.0 (20091210.2329)
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Support labelangle also for nodes. Currently only edge labels can be rotated. By means of orientation, a node's shape can be rotated, but the label cannot be rotated at this moment. Please fix this.
<br>

Fixing this bug will provide consistent rotation functionality on both edge labels and node labels. Also, it would allow users to rotate node's shape and label at the same time.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

digraph G {
    b [shape=""box"" label=""Bbb"" orientation=""20"" labelangle=""20"" ]
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Also it would ease fixing the following bug: http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/b1968.html

[erg]
Unfortunately, the labelangle attribute has no relation to the angle text makes with the horizontal. It, along with labedistance,
provides a way by which the user can control where a headlabel or taillabel is placed. I believe this is largely a hack because Graphviz
doesn't provide a more general-purpose label placement algorithm. With labelangle and labeldistance, you can avoid having the label
on top of the head or tail node.

Rotating text is a totally different problem and, in a sense, easier, assuming one can rely on the pango library, which should support
right-to-left text, top-to-bottom text, boldface, underlining, etc. as well as text rotation. It's just a matter of someone having the time
and expertise to hook these features into the Graphviz model. :)

[pander]

I have dug up the following information on rotating in pango and in pango with cairo:
<CD>
http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-Cairo-Rendering.html#rotated-example
http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-Glyph-Storage.html#pango-matrix-rotate
</CD>

If there is a bounty/donation system for Graphviz, I would certainly support implementation of these and some other bugs/features.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Dear Sirs.
<br>

I've been having a quite unfamiliar problem using graphviz. I'm building an application
that uses graphviz to design some process models.
<br>

When i started to use subgraphs, sometimes graphviz crashes without any ""possible debug"" message.
<br>

I've trying to figure out what the problem is, but what i found out is that if
i just delete some of the lines of my deployed dot file, without any known logic, it works, so i can't find any logic
concerning this error. I've tried to update to your last version but the problem persists.
<br>

Is it possible to try a help me on this ?
<br>

Best regards,
<br>

Carlos Liborio
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

<private>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Please keep my input private.

[ellson]
Carlos asks for his graph to be kept private.  Could you remove it from the bug system, please?

Carlos,

I worked your graph a little, so that at least it generates something:
<CD>
    - I moved all edge declarations outside of the clusters.
    - I removed a number of duplicate node declarations.
    - I moved a few nodes into, or out of, clusters where it seemed to make sense, but I'm sure I got it wrong.
    - I added null labels to Initialization and End, since the fixed size leaves no room for the text.
</CD>

There doesn't seem to be a good flow to your graph for a nice looking directed layout with dot.  Hopefully this is something you can fix now that you can see the output.

I tried using the ""fdp"" layout engine, which also supports clusters, but the result doesn't look any better.

Hope this helps?

Graphviz uses (or should be using) pango for its text layout.  Pango is certainly not assuming fixed width characters.

I don't understand what you mean by ""diverges"" ?   Are you saying that dot produces good output on the test case,
but bad output if a single ""-' is removed?

I can't reproduce this on Linux, so it may be specific to the Windows version.

It sounds like you are switching graphviz versions a lot?  Could you double check that
this problem occurs on a recent version of graphviz by checking ""dot -V"" ?   (I'm concerned that you
might have multiple copies of dot installed.)

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When dot.exe is run using GVEdit.exe as a front end, the program uses a
temporary file whose name (___temp.dot) is hard-coded into the program.
This prevents users from running multiple instances of dot.exe to take
advantage of multi-core processors. My computer has 2x6 cores, and with
the current version of dot.exe, i can't take advantage of parallel
processing capabilities of my computer. I am processing about 7 extremely
large dot files, and currently i have to wait for one to finish before
starting another one.
<br>

To replicate the problem, create a fairly large dot file, (mine is 1.7 mb
containing about 25,000 lines and about 10-15k nodes) and open it in
gvedit.exe. Click run and choose SVG and uncheck ""preview"" and click Ok.
<br>

While the first one is running, open another similarly large file
in another instance of GVEdit (because the first one is blocking and
waiting on dot.exe to finish). Choose the same run options and click ok.
An error message will be displayed, saying that the second GVedit
couldn't create a temporary file.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:05:00-04","2020-07-21 00:00:12.055-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

VERSION: 2.26.3
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hey guys,
I have tried to build graphviz on cygwin with gcc [ --version reports: (GCC) 3.4.4 (cygming special, gdc 0.12, using dmd 0.125) ]
and found a problem on file graphviz-2.26.3/lib/gvpr/compile.c at the declaration/definition:
Since I'm compiling for cygwin, WIN32 is not defined, and got error on line #83
<CD>
error: initializer element is not constant, both for gprDisc.mem and gprDisc.id attribute members
   80 #ifdef WIN32
   81 static Agdisc_t gprDisc = { 0, 0, &gprIoDisc };
   82 #else
   83 static Agdisc_t gprDisc = { &AgMemDisc, &AgIdDisc, &gprIoDisc };
   84 #endif
</CD>
<br>

Seems the problem may be due compiler ""should"" not know where externals AgMemDisc and AgIdDisc will be placed at compile time
(despite it doesn't yell 'cause of gprIoDisc which is declared on same module), and that would only be determined at link time,
which could be much later if that could be a loadable module...
<CD>
C90 said this in the constraints section of 6.5.7, ""Initialization"":
C99 says this in the constraints section of 6.7.8, ""Initialization"":
</CD>
<br>

well, the solution given for WIN32 conditional code seems to solve the problem, despite I also
didn't like to have to initialize it everywhere, have found some sugestions such as defining all
global external vars (default static) in a .c module where we may control their order of creation
the disadvantage would be gprDisc would be visible in other modules if they also see the extern
declaration, but no one has said it must be in a header file, only the interested modules that
share these globals need to know about them, externalized on on a header only those that need
to be found everywhere)
<br>

Anyway, if the codes guarded with conditionals WIN32 were also compiled the problem would
be already solved, seems to be the only places that happened.
Also would like to suggest if a build version for cygwin could be included on the site.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
I prefer to keep these strangenesses localized. To me, the ideal solution would use configure to determine if the compilation
system supports addresses of external objects in initializers, and wrap the code with a specific preprocessor variable. Given
that this problem is very limited, the simplest solution would be to replace #ifdef WIN32 with something like #if WIN32 || CYGWIN.
We already use

<CD>
  #if defined(WIN32) && !defined(**MINGW32**) && !defined(**CYGWIN**)
</CD>

several places in the code.

By the way, during some recent clean up, we lost the related mechanism for lt_preloaded_symbols in dot_builtins.c.
This doesn't compile on Windows for the same reason. On Windows, the structure needs to be initialized at runtime.

Would be great do be able to define some css like class system inside a graph.
This would allow to spare a lot of code on each node or edge or whatever.
You would simply write

nodename [class=""myClassName""]
<br>

and whatever is defined for myClassName would be assigned. Everything defined else for this node would overwrite the class properties, it should be possible to assign more than one class as well.
<br>

I didn't thought about a syntax for defining the classes yet but it should be done inside a graph so the classes aren't some global thing, they are definable for one graph and its sub graphs.

I'm stuck.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]

To get you started, I suggest just:
<CD>
    yum install graphviz graphviz-gd graphviz-graphs graphviz-doc gts
</CD>
although I fear you will still have a problem with gts.

I'm not sure why those other packages aren't available.  Possibly because your system
hasn't been updated to RHEL-5.4 or better?  (our rpms are built on Centos-5.4). 

[francis]
It is RHEL 5.1
Do you have an older package which has been build on 
a compatible version.  

What I need is to be able to use dot.

Francis

PS.  I would update the bug, but can't find the entry in
the issuelist: http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/openbugs.html

[ellson]
The .el4 rpms are built without gts, so you could try installing those.   You will need graphviz and graphviz-gd since RHEL4 doesn't have pango/cairo, as I recall.

If that still doesn't work you might need to build from source.   I recommend that you first try:

```
rpmbuild --rebuild graphviz-2.27.20100401.0445-1.src.rpm
```

as that will give you a list of dependencies that you should install.  Do the best you can to find them all in the standard distribution, but don't worry if you are missing some.

Then grab the graphviz-2.27.20100401.0445.tar.gz sources (from Download->source on our website) and do:
<CD>
    zcat graphviz-2.27.20100401.0445.tar.gz | tar xf -
    cd graphviz-2.27.20100401.0445
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</CD>

configure should be able to handle the missing parts.

By using the latest nightly snapshot we will be better able to provide fixes if you run into trouble.

Chris, thank you for sending this, but we can't cover all

focus on the most recent ones.  If there is a more
specific error message, maybe someone can look
into it further,

[erg]
If you have Visual Studio on your machine, we do make available the project files with the source,
so it's not difficult to build the software from scratch.

This isn't as easy as running an install, and it assumes your version of Visual Studio is compatible with
the project files, but it's a possibility.

Thanks for fast response!

I have created a 3 pages pdf output and kept the two intermediate files, which normally are deleted.
I use Gramps and we are working a way to get all children with or without. spouses in birth order 
This seems to be tricky. It works for a ""vertical"" family tree, but not for a ""horizontal"".

I any case the commands to create the files are:
<CD>
dot -Tps:cairo -o""/home/peter/tmp/tmpovyg3v.ps"" ""/home/peter/tmp/tmp_WxDxb.gv""
cairo: out of memory

quit
</CD>

As you see I get two out of memory.

If I use the command
dot -Tps rel_graph3P_26_2.gv | ps2pdf - rel_graph3P_26_4.pdf

I get rel_graph3P_26_4.pdf with three pages.

(I have renamed the temporary files.)

I have another question regarding this type of graph.
We have now a correct graph if we have a vertical family tree.
The order of children changes when I create a horizontal family tree just by changing
rankdir=""TB"" to rankdir=""RL""

This is obviously not enough to get the correct order. What should we do to achieve this?

I know this is a little bit off topic, but ...

[ellson]
Trying to manually control layout in dot is generally an uphill battle, but you could try:

```
graph [ordering=out]
```

which is documented as:

```
If ""out"" for a graph G, and n is a node in G, then edges n->* appear left-to-right in the same order in     which they are defined. If ""in"", the edges *->n appear left-to-right in the same order in which they         are defined for all nodes n.
```

Sometimes you can also control layout by adding invisible edges.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:08:11-04","2023-01-28 00:05:28.351-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

I used dot to generate a large graph with about 4000 nodes, then it ran out of memory and crashed.
<br>

Is it a bug or something?
How do I use dot to generate a large graph?
<br>

Thanks a lot.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] There is no a priori reason that dot should not be able to handle
the memory requirements for a 4000 node graph. Without seeing the graph,
there is no way to tell if this is a bug, or your graph just needs that
much memory.

The problem seems to occur when I have multiple nested clusters in the graph.  Here is the relevant part of a backtrace:

As I've been trying to debug this myself (based on my very limited understanding of the code) I've noticed that I get a lot of sets of colinear vertices within the polygon used for calculating the spline.  I tried tweaking the code to massage the polygon data by removing the ""extra"" vertex when three adjacent colinear vertices existed before passing the polygon to triangulation.  Eventually that lead to an abort() further down the road when it was unable to find a triangle containing one of the edge endpoints.  In my case the endpoint was on the border of a triangle.
<br>

Alas, I'm spinning my wheels not getting anywhere at this point.  I'm including some sample input that caused the crash above.  Sorry for the length of the sample.  This is the smallest sample I've been able to replicate the crash with.
<br>

Thanks in advance.
<br>

Devin Pitcher

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

It would be nice if setting a penwidth to zero would cause graphviz to omit the line.
<br>

Allowing this as part of the spec would reduce the need to pre-process data.
<br>

e.g.
<CD>
|   | A | B | C |
| A | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| B | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| C | 1 | 0 | 0 |
</CD>

A->B [penwidth=2]

B->B [penwidth=1]
B->C [penwidth=3]
C->A [penwidth=1]
C->B [penwidth=0]
C->C [penwidth=0]
}
</CD>
<br>

I'd want to omit lines where penwidth=0.
<br>

Thanks,
   M.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
Well, it almost does that now, except the arrowhead does not disappear. Technically, that is correct, since
the body of the edge is drawn as a line, subject to penwidth, while the head is a filled triangle. On the other
hand, since the arrow head gets larger with penwidth, one might expect it to get smaller as well.

<BR>
<IMG SRC=""b1875.png"">
<BR>

Also, when dir=both, the arrows at the edge head no longer increase, though the arrow tails still do. Odd.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Pros of this approach:
<CD>
- It makes it _much_ easier to manage graphs with several consistent styles or combinations of styles.
- It is a simple solution (both technically and conceptually).
- It is immediately intuitive to everyone who used CSS.
- It is backward compatible with existing files.
- It is a natural extension of the current syntax.
  </CD>

[north]
This is very interesting and we have often thought about a feature like this.

The implementation would probably be a little more complicated than just
changing the parser. What if ""classes"" are modified after the graph has been read?
(Or can classes be set on objects in a graph that is constructed entirely in memory?)
The graph output routine probably should be aware of classes at least to avoid
writing out all the individual attributes that are class-defined.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:02:39-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm trying to simplify some complex graphs and it seemed like using
concentrate=true would do the job.
<br>

However, I'm also trying to cluster some particular nodes, which
appears to stop the concentrate from performing it's edge merging.
<br>

Examples that shows this are:
<CD>
digraph foo {
 graph [concentrate=true]
 a -> c -> d
 b -> c -> d
}
</CD>
<br>

Compared with:
<br>

<CD>
digraph bar {
 graph [concentrate=true]
 a -> c -> d
 b -> c -> d
 subgraph cluster_baz {
  d
 }
}
</CD>
<br>

Is this intended behaviour?  If so can anyone suggest a workaround, or
another way to edge-merge towards nodes inside clusters?
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

digraph bar {
 graph [concentrate=true]
 a -> c -> d
 b -> c -> d
 subgraph cluster_baz {
  d
 }
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

No, I believe the edges should be the same in both. A simple workaround in this case would be to
declare the graph strict:

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I've only encountered this a couple of times. Sometimes I can reproduce
it and sometimes I can't, which I realize makes it difficult for you to
fix. Regardless, I'm filing this bug anyway, in case it comes up again or
by some miracle, you're able to reproduce it, as well.
<br>

I'm also not a C programmer, which probably limits the amount of relevant
information I can provide, but I understand enough to read the Graphviz
source code and call C functions from other programming languages (in my
case, C#).
<br>

Essentially, it appears that if agmemread is called with invalid input
data, it corrupts memory. After an unknown number of calls, it begins
causing access violation errors (in C#, this results in an
AccessViolationException) even when the input data is valid.
<br>

I restarted my machine to get a clean slate and now it works fine. But,
I'm uncertain how many invalid calls I need to make until it starts
exhibiting these symptoms. In addition, once one application using
agmemread begins failing in this manner, every application on my machine
that uses agmemread also begins to fail. Although, I can't tell if this is
a coincidence or not.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north]
i believe the parser may be attempting to recover and in this
situation it may try to fetch an unknown number of input tokens.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm trying to make an interactive SVG file where clicking on an entry
pulls open a new window and writes a table of summary statistics about
the node.  I've been doing this with javascript and just a big
document.write command.  However, when the URL string exceeds a certain
length (~500 chars), then dot will crash when attempting to generate
the SVG (using just standard ""dot -Tsvg -Kdot"" command).  Reducing the
length of the URL string fixes the issue.  Unfortunately, I've tried to
think of other ways to write a new window on the fly, but it would be
really beneficial to keep everything in the single DOT file somehow.
I did try putting the same string in the SVG output and there was no
length problems there.

OS: X86-LINUX-UBUNTU 9.10 (KARMIC)

VERSION: 2.20.2
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When I apply the 'dpi' option of the graph with a value different from 72, the svg-output of any graphs is scaled out of view.
This results in bad results when using rsvg for post processing and also can be a problem, when displaying the resulting svg in browsers, viewers or using desktop previews.
<br>

The problem is a bad transformation generated in the main svg group `<g...> ... </g>` in the svg output:
the example provided by me results in a node with the text 'Hallo', when I display the the svg output in a browser (firefox) it only shows the upper left quarter of the node.
Also inkscape shows me, that the page of the output is only half height and half width of the actual group of the graph.
<br>

The problem can be seen in the group enclosing the graph in the svg output:

```xml
..
<CD>

<!-- title: G Pages: 1 -->

<svg width=""156pt"" height=""88pt""
 viewBox=""0.00 0.00 78.00 44.00"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">
<g id=""graph0"" class=""graph"" transform=""scale(2 2) rotate(0) translate(4 40)"">
<title>G</title>
</CD>
..
```

<br>

We can see a transform=""scale(2 2)....""
<br>

This is unnecessary, as the SVG documentation states:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#ViewBoxAttribute
<br>

Specifying the viewbox=""..."" in the line above and adjusting the width and height of the whole `<svg..> </svg>` is enough to get a bigger output with the 'dpi' attribute. The behaviour specified in the graphviz documentation can be achieved by manually editing the svg file to:

```xml
..
<CD>

<!-- title: G Pages: 1 -->

<svg width=""156pt"" height=""88pt""
 viewBox=""0.00 0.00 78.00 44.00"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">
<g id=""graph0"" class=""graph"" transform=""scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 40)"">
<title>G</title>
</CD>
..
```

<br>

as it would be with dpi=72.
<br>

This problem affects anyone, who uses the same file for raster and vector output or wants to get a vector output comparable to raster output. Also affected are some automated build chains as a trac plugin.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

digraph G {
graph [dpi=144]

Please note in the documentation that the bb attribute is written by

In general, there is nothing currently in the neato layout that
would let one limit the range of positions. Even in post-processing,
there is nothing that can cause a layout to shrink except the size
attribute, and this scales everything.

Given that your input graph has no edges at all, it is unclear what
you are trying to achieve.

<br>

Graphviz.app's attributes inspector knows about the graph's ""overlap"" attribute, but not
about the ""overlap_scaling"" attribute described here:
<br>

http://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:overlap_scaling
<br>

Is there a method on your end by which newly-defined (or at least newly-documented)
attributes get automatically added to Graphviz.app? Would probably be a good idea.
<br>

<br>

The ""Where is the problem"" menu on this bug report form should probably contain
""Graphviz.app"".

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Haven't had any problems installing this on Ubuntu or Wix XP, not sure what the issue is here, but give me something to try and I'll be happy to
jump in.

[north]
I think we'lll have to generate a separate package for OSX 10.5
and not try to share 10.5 and 10.6

I'm not too optimistic that ""the team"" can afford to support the
many different versions of Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, not to
mention Solaris (still), HP-UX, AIX, ...

[bill]
I think I can probably afford the $30 upgrade to 10.6 if that will get me up and running.

You have my sympathy on the multiple ports issue...wrestled with that one for years in a prior lifetime.

[north]
Bill, I need to check specifically on what kind of builds we are doing.

In looking in http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/development/macos/snowleopard/
in the log.txt files it appears we are building on OSX 10.5 even when allegedly trying
to make a 10.6 package.  

We'll need to address this when we get back in to the office next week.

I don't understand what is going wrong on your system; sorry for the troubles.

I have installed the distributed packages on 10.6 recently without any drama.

[ryan]
In regard to this user's inability to install Graphviz on Mac OS X 10.5:

http://graphviz.org/bugs/b1847.html

You can advise him that installing Graphviz using MacPorts works fine, on Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6. So that's an available workaround. The port he should use is ""graphviz-gui"" (for the latest stable release) or ""graphviz-gui-devel"" (for the latest development snapshot).

[arif] Do you see graphviz in start menu?

[shashi]
Yes I can see it in the start menu.  
However, I am cannot find Dot.exe reqired for Protégé application.

[arif]
If you see the menu items and can't find the executables , it is really
strange.
Can you use windows' search tool and search the entire hdd for dot.exe.
Because I know windows vista have two different set of system folders one
for 32 bit one for 64 for bit and your default program files folder might be
somewhere else if you have a 64 bit machine.
You can also run gvedit and try to create a layout. It should automatically
detect dot.

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
- add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
   during execution
- add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
   during linking
- use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
- have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

Do you have a multiarch host?   You may need /usr/lib64 ahead of /usr/lib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
since apparently the libexpat.so in /usr/lib is not what you compiler is expecting.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] I suspect this bug is due to building on Leopard (with python-2.5) and then running on SnowLeopard (with python-2.6).

I suspect the fix requires adding a SnowLeopard build host.

[north]
Well, we could try adding a Snow Leopard build host.

I'm working on configuring one in the lab now.

It appears we can't get away with having one package for both OSX 10.5 and 10.6
if people want to use advanced features like scripting plugins.
This is not that surprising.

<br>

Here's my user story:
<br>

I'm performing software model checking with SPIN and Promela.
The tool I'm using (spinSpider) generates automata graphs with Dot.
<br>

However, some of the edges were not looking very good so I tried to convert
a Dot graph into Dia file format. It would be possible for me to
edit some of odd-looking graphs manually.
<br>

Here's the command I used:
<br>

Surprise! no arrow heads... I tried a bitmap format (png): worked fine.
I tried a vector-based format (svg): worked fine too.

A correct Dia file would have been great for manual editions of graphs
prior to showing them off in a term paper.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

See bug #1507. It's the same issue, but here is a fix.
The limit on GD/PNG dimensions is 231-1, not 215-1.
The limit on the total pixels is 232-1.
The formats GIF, JPG, and WBMP have limits on each dimension of 215-1 or 216-1.
<br>

Dot tends to build long rectangular graphs, where one dimension can exceed the
16-bit limit, while the other fits in a common desktop display.
This means the abort in the file gvrender_gd.c is premature.
<br>

Attached is a patch. It attempts to support 31-bit dimensions for PNGs,
where the total size fits in 32-bits. There are multiple code paths
for PNGs due to the plethora of graphviz optional plugins.
This patches the GD and Cairo code paths.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:58-04","2021-04-02 00:04:13.123-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Hello,
<br>

drawing the undirected graph (see ex. above) is OK when using neato in a

length of edges seems to be not considered within Graphviz.

may be neato not fully implemented in Graphviz ?
anyway, dot, neato are great programs !

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg]
John Ellson may be better able to comment on this but one suggestion is to make sure
you are using gmake.

If all you want is to run dot, you do not need sfio. You need to do a ""make install"" of the
necessary libraries in the lib directory. You only need
<CD>
 cdt graph gd pathplan vpsc rbtree sparse patchwork common
 pack gvc circogen dotgen fdpgen neatogen twopigen sfdpgen osage
</CD>
Then do a ""make install"" in the plugin directory, then a ""make install"" in cmd/dot.

[yoann]

I modify the Makefile of .../graphviz-2.24.0/lib like this: 
<CD>

```
""SUBDIRS = cdt graph gd pathplan \
        vpsc rbtree sparse patchwork common \
        pack gvc \
        circogen dotgen fdpgen neatogen twopigen sfdpgen osage""

[erg]
At this point, I leave you in John Ellson's capable hands. It appears something is wrong with configure on HP.
At least, one would expect it not to use flags such as -mt or libraries such as X11 unless it was guaranteed they
were available and needed.

[ellson] Hah!  On HP I'm all at sea!

Could you try using gcc and gmake ?

[yoann]
You mean, I have to change some properties of the Makefile ?
I send you the Makefile of <A HREF=""b1806.txt"">lib</A> and 
<A HREF=""b1806a.txt"">plugin</A>, to my mind he already used gcc.

[yoann]
  Do you find something concerned my issue ?
You don't have a version of graphviz that you are sure it works on hp-unix ?

[ellson]

```
*Making all in sfio
Make: line 905: syntax error.  Stop.*

```

I've been able to reproduce this issue with HP's /usr/bin/make

The easiest solution seems to be to use GNU make from:

```
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-3.81.tar.gz
```

then this problem no longer occurs.

The next problem I hit is with HP's support for ""inline"" (or lack thereof)
I'll add a configure test for this.

[ellson]
Please ignore this.... apparently some problem does still occur, although sometimes the sfio build completes...

I'm looking at it.....

[ellson]
OK, The above problem was apparently caused by having GNU make still called ""make"".  Even though it was ahead of /usr/bin/make in my $PATH.    Problem solved by renaming GNU make to gmake.

I didn't get very far with HP's cc either   (aCC: HP aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.55 [Dec 04 2003])
and the linker doesn't seem to generate shared libs?

There are a few small changes in CVS, which should be in tomorrow's snaphot, but with those I was able to
build with:
<CD>
 `./configure --disable-shared --enable-static`
</CD>

and get a working dot_static executable.

[yoann]
Thank for all your done.

./configure --disable-shared --enable-static
sh: ./configure:  not found.
Cf screenshot joined.

```

Maybe the easiest way is you send me your hp-ux version which works ? Maybe I even don't need to recompile the version...
I can give you the address of my ftp server ?

[ellson]
To build from CVS you would need extra tools;  autoconf, automake, libtool, swig, bison, flex, ...
The chances of getting this working on HPUX are ... slim to none.

There is a new graphviz...tar.gz snapshot this morning that contains the changes and the generated
components such as ""configure"".

```
http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/development/SOURCES/graphviz-2.25.20091106.0545.tar.gz
```

I'm hoping this will work for you.

> Maybe the easiest way is you send me your hp-ux version which works ? Maybe I even don't need to recompile the version...
> I can give you the address of my ftp server ?

Since I don't regularly build on HPUX it would be better if you were able to build your own binaries from the tar.gz, but sure, I'll send you mine.  Just send me your ftp url privately.

[yoann]
Ok I will try with the new version.

You can send me your binaries version on

VERSION: 2.25
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I have a simple directed graph and want to format it with the circo
layout to put it in a paper.  Unfortunately, that layout uses much too
long edges, so that the graphic won't fit on a page if the text should
still be readable.
<br>

So how do I tell circo to use much shorted edges to compress the overall
size?
<br>

If that's not possible at all, I don't need to stick to circo.  It just
looks appropriate for that graph.

What we see is the $cmd variable is empty. its seems that the function is not returning a string, it just prints to the console. Similarly, 'eval [$g render]' draws nothing, because the command string prints to console and is not returned.
<br>

Neither does '$g render $c' draw to canvas, it just prints string of commands to console.

Perhaps tcl is being compiled without USE_TCL_STUBS enabled?

Original ID: 1718
Reported By: Jeremy Douglass

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2009-09-21 09:13:47

OS: X86-OSX-10.5.8

VERSION: 2.24.0
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Using dot on a graph with rank=same causes an ""Abort trap"".
<br>

Command:
<br>

`dot -v -Tpng alternatives-test2.dot -otest2.png`
<br>

Changing the order in which edges are defined works around the problem (when rank=same for 7, 8, introduct 7->foo, 8->foo before either 7->8 or 8->7).
<br>

It is also possible to work around the problem by combinations of simplifying the graph (removing edges from the top or bottom of the list) AND moving the rank=same command to the bottom.
<br>

Other bugs have described related rank=same problems, and for given short files suggest fixes such as moving the rank=same command to the bottom. I factored my file down to a 5-node cluster, and this worked for the cluster -- however it did not work for the full file when there were more edges / weights present. This is why I submitted this bug with a more complex example, to show that this behaves more like the complex interaction of two bugs.

`digraph test { a [label=""line1\nline2"", URL=""http://www.graphviz.org""];}`
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[joerg.matz] Please remove the bug entry I submitted today. I've found a work around for this issue.

Using HTML / UTF8 encoded linefeeds (`&#10;&#13;`) instead of ""\n"" sequence,  I can separate the lines in the graphic output as well as in the imagemap.

[erg] This should still be fixed.

Hi,
<br>

I display nodes filled with images, I'd like to have link on nodes to an URL to make it interactive.
With text nodes, URL link is acive, but with image node it's not.
<br>

I'm using SVG for the display.
Please feel free to take a look here: it take a few seconds for the graph to show up.

[erg] The file you submitted with the bug report doesn't appear to have any node with both image and URL attributes,
so it wouldn't exhibit the problem you describe. It would be helpful if you sent us a small graph causing the problem,
and the svg output produced so we could use these in checking the problem.

<br>

I don't believe bug 1561 is ""fixed"":
<br>

http://www.graphviz.org/bugs/b1561.html
<br>

Firefox (on Linux, anyway) _ignores_ the ""font-size"" attribute unless it
comes with a font size unit, which renders the attribute useless and
makes it necessary to edit the svg file manually.
<br>

It would be far more convenient if something like fontsize=""11px"" could
be coded straight into the .dot file.

i am using graphviz in my Java application for representing relations between employees. You're doing a great job. I think it will be a nice feature if you'd add a possiblity to draw multiple peripheries with different colours.

Unfortunately, the error still occurs.
I installed the stable version (graphviz-2.24.0.pkg) over whatever has been installed before.
Is there anything I should delete, could there be leftover files from previous installs?

Looks like you had an old Pixelglow Software version of the Graphviz GUI lying around. You should do a spotlight search for Graphviz and delete all other versions of Graphviz especially those that are 1.xx. Ensure that your Time Machine backup drive is off line just to be sure. Then run the latest stable installer again (2.24.0).

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north]
Maybe we should just drop the Windows version!
We have so many problems with this particular platform.

It is well known that #IND means ""indeterminate"" (a.k.a. NAN in
other operating systems) so there is some (apparently new)
floating point discrepancy in how the Windows executables
do something. e.g. #IND can be an overflow (divide by 0). 

[erg] This problem is arising from some obscure bug in our Voronoi code used for overlap removal. It goes away if you
even use a different initial layout using the start attribute.

We really don't recommend Voronoi overlap removal algorithm any more. Even though it usually works, the final
layout is not as satisfactory as other algorithms. Especially with 2.24, we recommend setting overlap=prism.

We should also think about possibly making overlap=false correspond to prism. We like to keep things backward
compatible, but this is now a case where the ""default"" value is not a good choice.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:30-04",NULL,"[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"

Can you give more information? Are there error messages? It appears you tried running dotty on the file.

I am using Ubuntu 8.04 (Ubuntu Ultimate) with gcc version 4.2.4 (x86_64-linux-gnu).

When I run `dot` with try.dot, I am getting Segmentation Fault!

I am not able to run dotty for the past 2 weeks. My dotty version is 2.16 and I found no upgrade packages to 2.2x versions of dotty, although I get i386 versions which does not match my comp architecture. So, I recently download the lib64 components to my /usr/lib64. I hope thats not causing the problem.

Is there dotty for my x86 architecture? If so, where should I look for download.

[erg] As far as I am aware, dotty is available in all releases. Since I 
build from source, I'm not aware of anything missing. I'll ask John
Ellson about this.

As for the dot bug itself, please upgrade to a more recent version.
I'm pretty sure the problem is fixed. At least, I can't replicate it.
If you still have problems with the new version, please let us know.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] Given the trace output, dot got into the node positioning phase and never finished.
With 598956 nodes and 900182 edges, the optimization problem will take a long time.
Since your report seems to imply that the program ""finished"", I can only assume that
Windows has some resource limits, such as CPU time, dot exceeded them and got kicked out.
(At least, this would be the case on Unix systems.) On the other hand, I would have
expected an error message, or a bad return value so that GVedit would not report success.

[david] Nothing in the Windows event log. In watching the Windows Task Manager I
can tell you that during the run, dot.exe uses 50% of the CPU for about
a half an hour until the memory usage climbs to about 500,000 K.  I am
trying to render in dot output, and then I will run again with the neato
engine to see if we can pair down closer to where the problem is.

[north] 750,000 edge crossings?

It's not likely to be very readable, unfortunately. 

[david] I'd like to see one complete - I can worry about readability next. 

[north] With graphs that size you really might find it a lot easier
to use command line tools.

I'd suggest using a Unix-type system as well instead
of Windows, though technically Windows should work OK.
I do think that some versions of Windows get into real
trouble when they hit a resource limit, e.g. start swapping.
(Linux has its problems too.)

I wonder how you will be viewing a 600,000 node graph.
Are the nodes labeled?  If you had a 600,000 word

VERSION: 2.23
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

libgd and cairo produce different font glyphs even when using the same
fonts. The input file uses both Times-Roman and URW Gothic L.
Cairo resolves both to /usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/Vera.ttf. Libgd
resolves the latter to /usr/X11/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/Vera.ttf, but the
former is resolved to /Library/Fonts/Times New Roman.ttf.
<br>

The two output files show the results from 
<A HREF=""b1648.gif"">-Tgif</A> and <A HREF=""b1648a.gif"">-Tgif:gd</A>.
The two outputs are different. For the second node, even though
both outputs use the same font, the glyphs are different.
<br>

The libgd behavior is identical using the Graphviz libgd and the
one on the system.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] Comparing the Times-Roman nodes, where glyphs appear in both
outputs, against the Unicode standard, it is clear that libgd is
getting the correct glyphs and that cairo is putting up incorrect
glyphs. Apparently, Vera.ttf does not have valid glyphs for those
characters, hence the blanks.

<br>

Hi,
<br>

I was wondering if grappa supported HTML-Labels ? From my tests, I guess it doesn't.
First, I 'm not sure I understand why ? Isn't the rendering done on dot side.
I would like some advice if possible in order to assess what it would take to add such a support to grappa.
I have enclosed what I'm trying to produce, it works fine locally, but not via grappa. The dot enslosed do not contains edges as I'm only intersted in rendering tables right now.
<br>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] I'm somewhat surprised as well since, indeed, grappa uses xdot output to draw
the nodes, and HTML-like labels use simple and ancient xdot op codes. On the other hand,
grappa is legacy code and code does rot. I have cc'ed the author of grappa on this
response.

[john] 
You are confusing Yoix with Grappa... Grappa just uses position information and does most of the rest of the work itself (thus one could draw a graph using Grappa without using dot at all as long as you set the position attribute for the nodes and edges yourself). Yoix uses xdot and should handle everything as expected.

[erg]
I was getting my history confused. Grappa predates xdot; it gets its position information from dot, but it does all of the drawing
on its own. The pseudo-successor to grappa, yoix (http://www.yoix.org/), supports xdot, so should be able to handle anything described
by dot. In fact, xdot was created for Yoix.

As to how it hooks up with Graphviz, for that you'll have to check the Yoix documentation. Or, as Stephen suggested, you may
find some other tool will serve.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:01:28-04","2021-05-29 00:01:21.3-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

OS: *-LINUX-FEDORA 10

VERSION: 2.16.1-0.6.FC10
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Graphviz Dot can generate SVG files for 'rounded,filled' boxes that are defined like this:
<br>

digraph process
{
   graph [rankdir=TB]
<br>

   ff [shape=""box"" style=""filled,rounded""];
}
<br>

When Dot is used to generate the SVG file, (dot ff.dot -Tsvg -o ff.svg) then the filling of the rounded corners of the box are drawn like this:
<path style=""fill:lightgrey;stroke:lightgrey;"" d=""M12,-36C6,-36 1.83557e-14,-30 1.53951e-14,-24""/>
<br>

And the stroke is drawn like this:
<path style=""fill:none;stroke:black;"" d=""M12,-36C6,-36 1.83557e-14,-30 1.53951e-14,-24""/>
<br>

This is a rather complex way to generate rounded corners.
There is an easier way to generate SVG rounded corners.
(the way Inkscape generates them)
<CD>
<rect
       style=""fill:#ffff00""
       id=""rect2383""
       width=""368.57144""
       height=""257.14285""
       x=""120""
       y=""186.6479""
       ry=""12.595651"" />
</CD>
<br>

This way you only need to specify the roundness of the corners using 'ry'.
<br>

Why do I think this should be changed?
The current way of generating SVG rounded corners does not allow for easy post-processing of the generated SVG.
For example, this script does not work nicely on SVG:

VERSION: 2.22
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

An UTF-8 encoded dot file (with BOM header) can be accepted and
processed by dot.exe in cmd enviroment. Like:
<CD>
""C:\dot UTF8.dot -Tpng -o UTF8.png"", it works right.
</CD>
<br>

However, if the file is opened in Gvedit.exe, it seems that the editor
could not process it correctly. And I find the provided editor
Gvedit did some default works after opening the UTF-8 encoded file.
<br>

The details of the changes are depended on the encode type of the
input file.
<br>

If the file is encoded with UTF-8, the editor will remove the UTF-8
BOM header. And it will result in a syntax error when dot.exe processes
the file. Like this:
""Error: Invalid 2-byte UTF8 found in input. Perhaps ""-Gcharset=Latin1""
is needed?""
<br>

If the file is encoded with Unicode-16(litte endian), the editor will
remove all content except the first 3 bytes. And the editor will display
nothing or just some strange characters. It also will result in a
syntax error when dot.exe processes the file. Like this:

""Error: ... syntax error near line 0

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north] Glen, it appears that a NIB file is part of the application.
Therefore either our installer was corrupted, or the build partially failed, or ... ?

[glen]
From your install logs, it seems that the Installer tried to overwrite the older 1.13(16) app to 2.23. It refused to do so because it thinks that 2.23 is too old compared to version 16.0. Unfortunately, the 1.13(16) app was incorrectly labelled with an internal version of 16.0 rather 1.13.

The immediate fix is to delete all 1.xx versions of Graphviz from your system and try to do an install again.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north] Thank you for the information.  There may be some things we need to clean up.

Regarding your statement, ""The files under graphviz-2.22.2/lib/gvc are under LGPL"",
I do not believe this is correct, as many of the files were written by us. Are you referring
to the regex source files only?

Regarding libgd, since gdft.c refers to code from tclUtf.c from the TCL release, which
in term refers to license.terms.

Since you are pointing this out as a problem, did you find and read those terms and is
there some reason you are not satisfied?

Now I'm wondering why a representative of Nokia is acting as a police inspector, though
we do appreciate the opportunity to keep our code free of unwanted legal entanglements.

As you may know, AT&T, including AT&T Mobility is a major customer of Nokia. We hope
there is a spirit of good will and cooperation.  I work closely with the office of the
Chief Scientist of AT&T so if you see a problem here I can escalate it at once. Who
is your executive officer at Nokia? 

[simon]
If we want to include open source software in our releases then we need to have the sources checked for any errors.
We are not the police and this is not important to raise with any managers.
I report any mistakes found to authors of OSS to try to get them resolved.

Do you have any comments about the plugin/quartz files?

[ellson]
The LGPL licensing problem in lib/gvc is just with regex_win32.[ch].  Arif, can you see about removing these?  They are
only used for matching gvplugin dll filenames. 
The lib/gd contents are a fairly recent copy of gd, so if there are licensing problems in there, its really a gd problem.
If push-comes-to-shove we can drop lib/gd entirely from our sources, by adding a prebuild requirement for a recent gd
to centos[345].

Presumably Glen can fix the license in graphviz-2.22.2/plugin/quartz/GVTextLayout.[mh] ?

Is it really so that we are not permitted to link statically with LGPL libraries?   In which case we have a big problem with
Glen's binaries for MacOSx which pull in all kinds of LGPL stuff.    MacPorts builds use shared libraries so don't have a problem - except that we can't ship prebuilt binaries.

The mingw builds use shared libs, what about the VisualC builds?

We also have support for --enable-static on other platforms, but we don't ship any binaries built with this in .rpms or .debs.
Perhaps we need to add a big warning to ./configure to not distribute any binaries built --with-static?

[arif] This is a pango related problem that we have been aware of for a while.

For a quick solution you can use gd to generate the output

dot -Tpng:gd   blankOutput.gv -oblank.png

P.S:Because of the lack of anti-aliasing ,your output would  look little uglier than what you are used to.

[ellson] I'm trying to understand whats going on in your problem #2.

I think I understand that you're getting blank output for the command:

   dot -Tpng blankOutput.gv  
Is that right?

Could you repeat the command that causes the problem, but add ""-v"" to that command and save the stderr and the output please?  So:

   dot -v -Tpng blankOutput.gv -oblankOutput.png >err

then send me ""err"" and ""blankOutput.png""",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:05:57-04","2020-10-30 00:02:28.658-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I can't seem to generate this graph, and I would really like to see it!

[ellson] I suggest you start with a small fragment of that graph, and experiment with it to get the graph syntax correct.
In particular, the label syntax is incorrect.

Trying to force rank with rank=same means you are fighting with dot's own calculation of what the ranks should be.
Try without rank=same.

I was able to produce the attached PDF <A HREF=""b1594.pdf"">layout</A> 
from a modified <A HREF=""b1594a.dot"">version</A> 
of your graph using graphviz-2.22.
The graph is very large, so probably no point in even attempting any bitmap layouts.

[ellson]
No, I'm wrong, your labels are fine. This [rank=same] is the problem.
New <A HREF=""b1594a.pdf"">output</A> attached with labels 
<A HREF=""b1594b.dot"">restored</A>.

BTW.  If you take into account rotational and mirror symmetries, the rules for winning at tic-tac-toe are much simpler than this ;-)

[jeremy] Wow!
Thank you for the quick response! This happens to be 3x3 Connect 3, a simpler version of the much larger game that most people know, 7x6 Connect 4.

I'm sorry I didn't specify this in my bug report, but I already knew that I could generate the pdf if I left the rank=same stuff out. The thing is that is is more interesting to look at the 3x3 Connect 3 graph in terms of remoteness, that is, the number of moves until the game is over. That way, all of the winning/losing nodes should end at the bottom of the graph. However, right now the nodes are simply ranked by the number of pieces on the board, which is a less interesting representation. All I want to do is align the nodes to a certain row. Is there some way of controlling the layout of the nodes like that? While I know that using rank=same is breaking my graph, I don't know why. I believe that I am using that property correctly.

[ellson] I'm not convinced yet that this is a bug.   If you put too many constraints on a graph, then dot has to eventually give up.

I tried using rank=same on just rows ""0"" and ""9"",  then I found that dot wants to create additional rows below ""0"".

Aren't the solid nodes terminals?    Why do they have outedges?

(e.g.  h128 -> h288 )

Is it possible that you have some edges reversed?

Redhat is rpm based; why not just install the binary rpms?
If you really want to build from source, why not use:

```
rpmbuild --rebuild graphviz.*.src.rpm

Either way has the advantage of checking that you have all the dependencies installed.

There is now a graphviz-2.22.0 stable release, but I don't think that's the issue here.

Where did you get the installation package you are using?

2.6 is probably your Linux kernel number, not that version of Graphviz you have.
What is the output of ""neato -V""?

When you say x86-Linux-SLES 10, this seems to be a Novell Enterprise Server.
We do not support that platform - we don't even have one of those.  The bug
is very unusual.

If necessary can you give us an ssh account to log in and try it ourselves?

VERSION: 2.20.3
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

While testing a re-written VML plug-in, I found that occasionally
para->height is less than para->fontsize (see textpara.h).
This happens even when the string includes capital letters and letters
with descenders.  This causes problems because VML clips the ""textbox"".
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

The problem only occurred in the following .dot files - and only for some of the text strings.
 graphs/directed/table.html
 rtest/graphs/html2.html
 rtest/graphs/html.html
 rtest/graphs/ports.html
 rtest/graphs/url.html
 rtest/nshare/html2_dot.html
 rtest/nshare/html_dot.html
 rtest/nshare/ports_dot.html
In all cases para->height = 11.67 while para->fontsize = 14.00
Here are the 4 strings for rtest/nshare/ports_dot.html:
LEFT
MIDDLE
RIGHTTOP
RIGHTBOTTOM
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I've added a work-around to my VML plug-in.

## DESCRIPTION

good god this program just fucked me.  I was closing my .dot file and it asked me to save, so i did.  and then another popup asked me to save again came up. and i clicked yes.  So now i'm trying to open it again  and its showing 0 bytes.  its totally broken.  what the hell just happened?
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[arif] What Operating System are you using ? It sounds like Windows's GVedit
program for Graphviz.

[north] I'm sorry to hear about the problems.

I don't appreciate the use of profanity in a professional setting
or anywhere else for that matter.

With probably hundreds of thousands of downloads of this
software, whatever went wrong is probably not totally obvious
to any of us, and the bug report lacked much in the way of
details and my mind-reading skills are not that good.
For example, one would might wonder if there was some file
system problem. It is possible the disk was full, or that there
was a transient operating system error of some kind at the
time the data was lost. In fact what was the operating system?
What do the kernel or event log messages say around
the time that the error occurred?

Because there are only a few people working on this, we really
can't provide the same level of support that you might get
with a commercial product.  You might be more satisfied with
tools like Visio, or maybe yEd (from yWorks) or plain old
Adobe Illustrator.

Again sorry about the problems and hope not much time was
lost on anything important. 

[hugo]
Thank you for the quick reply. I am using GVedit on windows xp.  Part  of the problem may have been that I opened up the .dot file in word  and it saved it as a word document. I had just saved the program in  word and opened it up in gvedit to visualize the graph. Upon closing  the graph it asked me to save the .dot file and when I did it became a  0 byte document.  I only found out when I opened the file again in  graphviz.  I wish I had more details so you could recreate the bug.  There were no error messages.  Additionally, the graph had about 300  nodes and the output was in twopi.  Graphviz has been invaluable and I  appreciate your work in creating and maintaining the program.  I hope  this problem is on my end and is not a repeatable bug that will affect  other users.

I saved a dot file with Korean.

As graphviz.org says, no problems.
So I tried how to generate a Korean dot file.
And I found this.
<br>

On the commandline dot support Korean .
<br>

dot -Tpng Korean-UTF8.dot -o Korean-UTF8.png
<br>

But I tried to open and generate  this Korean-UTF8.dot in the GVedit.
GVedit does not generate dot file
<br>

It maybe could be problem with GVedit saving a temporary file
from original dot file. Later, GVedit tried to generate with
a temporary file.
<br>

And now , I tried to use proprocessor setting with iconv win32 to avoid this problem.
But I couldn't find .

Who knows how to use preprocessor setting?

Original ID: 1487
Reported By: Stephan Hennig

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2008-11-18 05:00:00

OS: _-_-*

VERSION: 2.20.3
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

<br>

Symptom:
  Zooming into the output of the attached graph that sets attribute
'splines' to false, one can see that edges A->B and B->C are not drawn
as plain line segments, but nearly straight Bézier curves.
  It looks like Graphviz tries to emulate line segments by ""straight""
Bézier curves, but numeric precision isn't good enough to obtain
satisfying results.  That is, control points are intended to lay on the
ray between the endpoints, but they slightly diverge.
  The symptom can be observed with different output formats (GIF, PNG,
JPG, EPS, PS, PS2, PDF).
<br>

Expected behaviour:
According to documentation after setting graph attribute splines to
false, edges are drawn as line segments, not Bézier curves.  Graphviz
should use true line segments:
<CD>
(i) to avoid problems in numeric calculations during rendering,
<br>

(ii) to speed-up rendering of many edges in post-processing applications
if output format is a vector format,
<br>

(iii) to yield smaller files (omitting unnecessary control points), if
output format is a vector format.
</CD>
<br>
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

digraph {
  graph[
    splines = false,
//    dpi = 600,
  ];
  A -> B;
  A -> C;
  B -> C;
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] I have entered your bug report as a modification request. At present, edges are represented internally as
a collection of B-splines. Line segments from point  p to point q are represented as the Bezier (p,p,q,q).
This may be tweaked due to clipping to node boundaries and adding arrowheads, but the resulting Bezier
should be indistinguishable at any reasonable scale from a line segment, especially since we now represent
points as two doubles.

Allowing explicit polylines would offer the advantages you suggest, but it would take a fair amount of effort
to add this, and there are other changes we feel would be of more importance to users.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:02:19-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

Running the command inside valgrind causes a read error:

1448                    points[pointn++] = ps[i];
</CD>
<br>

At the time it crashes ps=0x318, pointn=1153 and i=10. Looks like the
points array is not big enough and is overlapping the memory used for
storing the address of ps:
<br>

<CD>
(gdb) print &ps
$3 = (point **) 0xbeb06128
(gdb) print &points[pointn-1]
$4 = (point *) 0xbeb06124
<br>

</CD>
BTW, sizeof(point)=8, so the previous iteration actually overwrites the
ps variable.

More info on my previous bug-report today: I've located the

Commenting them out lets dot run in a few seconds (I've placed
a comment in the dot-file).

There's a total of 60 edges entering the node. I've tried
removing various numbers of them to see what happens. Here are

The dot file is attached. I've removed all node/edge decoration.
Also, the original graph had many more edges. I've removed all
edges having constraint=false. Let me know if you need it.

The (machine-generated) graph looks strange: it looks like there is
one single ""final"" node, destination of a large number of edges.

I've tried to remove edges, adding them back progressively
while dot managed to produce something in reasonable time.
Keeping only the first 700 edges is ok: you get the result
after around a minute. Keeping the first 800 edges appears to
throw dot into an infinite loop. Still, the 700-experiment gives an
idea of what the graph looks like.
<br>

I hope I provided enough information. If you need anything else,
let me know.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I'm using dot to visualize (sometimes big) control flow graphs,
that I use in my research on compilers. The whole graphviz package
is incredibly useful to me. You guys are doing splendid work.
Thanks a lot.

Original ID: 1471
Reported By: user442

SEVERITY: MINOR

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.21
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

The width and height attributes play two roles: on input, they specify
the minimum sizes; on output, they specify the final size. Normally, this
is okay, but if nodes has multiple peripheries, nodes will grow over time.
<br>

For example, with the suggested input graph, dot in.gv produces a very
different drawing than
<CD>
   dot in.gv | dot | dot | dot | dot
</CD>
<br>

This means that applications wishing to run dot multiple times must keep track
of any original width and height settings and restore them before calling dot.
<br>

From another viewpoint, the fixedsize attribute does not work as specified
since the size of the resulting node will be bigger than specified by the
width and height parameters, even if fixedsize=true.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Some effort has been made to sanitize the input data. However, I ask
that you please keep the input data file private, and not make it
available on the web.
Please also do not make my e-mail address visible on the web.

[erg]
I'm not sure I understand what the bug is. dot produces a layout which cannot fit into the
maximum size allowed for PNG output. It would be possible to put in code which, after
detecting this situation, would resize the output down to the maximum allowed. Usually,
however, we feel the solution is better left to the user. You can use the size attribute to
scale down the graph to an appropriate size; create output in a vector format like postscript
or svg; or alter the input graph or other of its parameters to get a smaller drawing.

We'll keep your input data private. It is our general policy to not post e-mail addresses.

Thats a reasonable solution. 

[cox] Thanks for the speedy response and the suggestions!  I hadn't tried using the size attribute before. So I read the documentation yesterday and gave it a try. Works great! That's what I needed to get around this issue. Much appreciated.

i think this is Mac-specific, and probably related to the quartz renderer.

Could you rerun ""dot -c"" on stayman so that I can take a look?

And did you work out how to run gdb on stayman?

No joy.

I reran dot -c, no change.  (I think it is run by make install anyway?)

it prints this curious message:

I hope this is not relevant to the quartz driver!  Who knows.

Perhaps I can scare up a copy of libssl.0.9.8.dylib   though it may have other dependencies.

If necessary I will have to either try reinstalling libssl, or, once again, blow away the entire Macports tree
and start over from scratch, which takes hours and I don't have time to attend to it today though maybe
it can be scriptified.

it is possible to gbd - first start dot, then attach gdb.  For some reason you can't launch dot
directly from gdb.

If you decide you can get to this soon and would like an account on stayman, I can make it if you don't already have one.
I guess I could copy your .ssh public keys to get you going.  Up to you.   All you need is command line access, since you
can easily copy .ps files back to your desktop machine.

SEVERITY: MINOR

VERSION: 2.21.0
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Documentation needs to explain when a Pango font specification is allowed,
and when a fontconfig specification is allowed.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

For extra credit, convert one into the other  :-) 

[ellson]
Assuming you have graphviz built with pangocairo, the syntax for dot's fontname attribute is pango's:
<CD>
   ""[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]""
</CD>
ref:
<CD>
   http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-Fonts.html#pango-font-description-from-string
</CD>
so:
<CD>
    fontname=""Calibri Bold""
</CD>
should give you what you want.

The current version of dot ignores any [SIZE] value and uses its own default, or the value given by ""fontsize=..."" instead.
We will investigate to see if we can at least accept pango's [SIZE] to override dot's default.

If you don't have pangocairo installed, then fontname is interpreted by the gd library and fontconfig, which unfortunately uses a different syntax:
<CD>
   fontname=""Calibri:style=Bold""
</CD>
should work.   My personal feeling is, don't use graphviz without pangocairo, but perhaps we can do something to make the syntax for uniform in this scenario.

If neither pangocairo nor fontconfig are available, then we fallback to some internal bitmap fonts.   In this scenario its probably best to just stick with the default font.

> Retaining first value found, discarding second.

This is a bug in the brewer color data, as far as I can tell.  Anyway, its not related to the problem with ""make -j2""

I think what is happening is that the inkpot make is running ahead of the rbrtee make.  I've made a couple of changes to prevent this, I hope.  We'll see with the next snapshot build. 

[north]
This inkpot feature could have been phased in more carefully.

However, in general make -j tends to fail on a high performance machine
(e.g. 4 CPU Mac Pro). 

[ellson] Its strange because I don't get these failures on other multi-core machines with make -j. Perhaps Macs are just that much faster.

There are other cross-library dependencies in the code that have the potential for the same problem.   I'm not convinced that the automake DEPENDENCIES feature that I just  tried actually works, unless the dependency is in a subdirectory.

I also rearranged the build order such that this specific problem should have gone away in the nightly builds but I still need a more rigorous solution...

Note that this problem only affects package builders, not users of binary packages.    If ""make -j"" doesn't work for package builds, then the immediate solution is to not use it.  It not like its important when running a build from a cron job in the middle of the night.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:22-04","2021-03-20 00:07:56.297-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

[ellson] Does this problem still exist in a recent release? \

[jocelyn] Yes, the bug is also in 2.20.2, installed by my ISP on 12th September or
thereabouts. Sorry, should have said. If there's a later version of
GraphViz out, I can try it on that tomorrow when I'm on a better
connection.

You can see the bug live if you press one of the first 4 buttons or the
final button on http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php , and
then goto the [diagram as VRML] link under the image that will appear.
That's using 2.20.2.

[ellson] Ah, OK, yes, there are no edge labels in 3d vrml output.  Node labels are gif images wrapped onto solid node shapes.    Do you have a suggestion for where edge labels
show be put in 3d ?

Better yet, the solution to this bug has to be in the form of code added to just one file:
   plugin/gd/gvrender_gd_vrml.c

Would you care to offer a patch?

See next field for test.dot.
<br>

You can see the result at http://www.j-paine.org/scratch/dot_problem.wrl .
The arrow that should connect p2 to a2 is in the z=0 plane.
<br>

The same problem occurs with similar dot files cntaining more arrows,
when drawn as VRML. Sometimes some arrows between z!=0 nodes are in
the right plane and others aren't. Similar graphs where all nodes
have z=0 get drawn correctly, except that the nodes are hard to read
(known bug) and that labels are missing from arrows (new bug?).
<br>

Background:
I'm using GraphViz to draw diagrams in category theory, as demonstrated
at http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php . I thought 3d
diagrams would be particularly useful to depict ""functors"": functions that transform
one network of relationships into a similar network. By drawing the two
networks in different planes, I hope to appreciate the
idea of different but structurally similar networks. Also, it's probably
easier to understand such diagrams when you can rotate to view from
different angles, rather than having one viewpoint into a 2d image. (I
say this because your FAQ suggests avoiding 3d where not essential.)

Any circumvention?

Probably the font issue I mentioned earlier, that we didn't fully explore.

https://mailman.research.att.com/pipermail/graphviz-interest/2008q3/005484.html

You suspected the Graphviz Quartz code of being the problem, but I was seeing the problem on both Tiger and Leopard, so at least on Tiger the Quartz code is not being used (since the Quartz code in Graphviz still requires 10.5 or greater, last I heard).

I believe you asked me for more info and I failed to respond -- so sorry! Where should we pick up on that?

There is some strange interaction between printing parsing error messages

and hits an error in the input graph, the next call to agread crashes.

Without errors or with a single read, everything is fine.

SEVERITY: CRITICAL

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.16
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I was using graphviz dot 2.16-3ubuntu2 to parse huge graphs,
and one of them segfaulted dot.
<br>

The graph had a deep nested structure, and it seems that dot wasn't
able to cope with that. The attached example is the minimal dot file
that triggers the problem.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

//usage: 'dot -Tsvg bracketbug-graphviz.dot'
//output: Segmentation fault

digraph ""bracketbug_outputs_segmentationfault"" {

node [label=""a""] ""b"" -> {
//33 brackets are fine, but
//34 brackets trigger crash
{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{
}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

}
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] I can reproduce this with:
<CD>
digraph ""bracketbug_outputs_segmentationfault"" {
node [label=""a""]
""b"" -> {
//33 brackets are fine, but
//34 brackets trigger crash
{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{c}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
}
}
</CD>

-Tsvg isn't needded for the crash to occur.

It crashes with or without the 'c', although without crashes in a different place, on an agstrfree("""")

```
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

History-
Everything worked OK in dot 2.18 after John (and Glenn?) fixed bug 1367
(by adding PEN_DOTTED and PEN_DASHED style to the Quartz renderer).

Relevance-
I use dot -Tjpg to generate jpg files and show them in the GUI of my tool.

[ellson] If you run ""dot -Tjpg:""  (i.e. with a trailing ':' ) you should get a list of alternate jpg renderers.  The first one is the default
that you are using.   Is it ""jpg:quartz:quartz"" ?

Could you do the following please?  Assuming your test graph is called foo.gv, run:
<CD>
`dot -v -Tjpg foo.gv >foo.jpg 2>foo.err`
</CD>
and send me both foo.jpg and foo.err.

As a work around, you can try any of the alternatives (if there are any?).    If you have it, try:
<CD>
`dot -Tjpg:cairo`
</CD>

Generally, jpg is not a particularly good format for line drawings because of its lossy compression.  It tends to blur lines and fonts.
Usually png is a better choice.

In addition, when I attempted to submit this bug report using the

  fontcolor=mediumblue;
  label=""2"";
  style=bold;
  color=mediumblue;

 }
}
```

</CD>

This simple dot code have the error ""Segment Violation"", is the same code but i try to make 2 edges that begin from the cluster ""cluster_1"":

<CD>

```
digraph G{
 compound=true;
 bgcolor=grey;
 node [style=bold, fontsize=20];
 edge [arrowsize=2, labelfontsize=20, style=bold];

 ""cluster_1"" -> ""2.2"";
 ""cluster_2"" -> ""1.1"";

 subgraph ""cluster_1""{
  fontsize=45;
  fontcolor=mediumblue;
  label=""1"";
  style=bold;
  color=mediumblue;

  fontcolor=mediumblue;
  label=""2"";
  style=bold;
  color=mediumblue;
  ""2.1"";
  ""2.2"";
 }
}
```

</CD>

This simple dot code have the error ""Segment Violation"" too. In this case I make a new cluster and change de end of the second edge that begin in ""cluster_1"":

<CD>

```

I have a sample lefty script that uses 4 widgets to create an array of a button and a text output box that are embedded in an array.
For most operations the script works fine.  Some specific operations will cause lefty to crash from what Windows says is, ""Unhandled exception in 'lefty.exe', 0xC0000005: Access Violation.""
<br>

To reproduce the error, load the below script into lefty. Left click once on the canvas to create ONE node. Then right click and select ""open dialog"".  The memory access violation should occur, causing lefty to crash.
<br>

It would be most helpful to solve this problem, as I have a fairly large program written that uses similar lefty script functionality.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

In a previous version of Graphviz (1.14, IIRC) touching or saving a graph Graphviz was displaying would cause Graphviz to automatically lay the graph out again from the updated file.  Graphviz no longer has this behavior.
<br>

Steps to reproduce:
<CD>
<br>

$ echo ""digraph { \""a\"" -> \""b\""; }"" > my_graph.dot
$ open my_graph.dot
$ echo ""digraph { \""a\"" -> \""b\"" -> \""c\""; }"" > my_graph.dot
<br>

Expected results:
<br>

Graphviz displays the graph with nodes a, b and c instead of just a and b.
<br>

Actual results:
<br>

Graphviz still shows the graph with nodes a and b only.
<br>

Re-opening the graph does not cause the graph to be re-loaded from disk:
<br>

$ open my_graph.dot
<br>

Graphviz gets focus but does not update the graph, only nodes a and b are shown.
<br>

Closing the graph (cmd-w) and running:
<br>

$ open my_graph.dot
</CD>
Will re-display the graph.

VERSION: 2.8
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I found that FIG files generated by GraphViz are too simple.
It is hard to modify them by hand.
<br>

The most serious problem is that all graphic elements are on
layer 0 (the very topmost one).
Users has no chance to put anything _over_ the graph.
<br>

Another difficulty is that node shapes are on the
_same_ layer as node labels. XFig does not guarantee drawing
order of object on the same layer. If I move a node half an inch
away it may occur that text becames invisible because filled
rectangle gets drawed on the top of it.
<br>

So it would be advisable using at least 3 layers.
E.g. layer 62 for node shapes, layer 61 for node labels
and layer 60 or 63 for edges (depending on you can see them
over or below the nodes.)
<br>

It would be useful to glue node shape and text into a composite
object.
<br>

No need to _draw_ black filled rectangles at the end of directed
edges. FIG has built in arrow attribute for lines. Using arrow
feature allow use to modify edges easier.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north] Since _you_ have a lot of expertise in _fig_ which we
do not have in our group, and it is not difficult to change
the printfs() in the fig generator, found in
 plugin/core/gvrender_core_fig.c
Please can you send us the source code for your
proposed improvements?  Otherwise I am afraid it
will not be done. 

[ellson] You are using a very old version of graphviz. I'm not sure if it will be what you want, but there is more use of FIG layers
in recent versions of graphviz.   Please try graphviz-2.20.2. 

[kissg] Unfortunately Debian stable distribution contains this.
If I have some spare time I try to build a binary package
from testing/unstable source.

[kissg] Done.
Background and graph edges already on separate layers.
However node boxes and text are on the same depth. (This is not bullet
proof.)
And user can not put any object yet over the picture yet because the
topmost layers (0-2) are used.
The other problems are unsolved too.

This weekend I try to modify the code in order to get a
bit reasonable output.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:04:04-04","2023-01-27 00:01:18.971-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

You assume the library name is perl. I have to change th ename when I build perl so I don't
conflict with another package we use.
<br>

It seems you should use the Config array and get the ""libperl"" entry and sed it from libperlxxx.so to perlxxx

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] Perhaps you could provide a patch for this obscure situation?

On my system, the perl lib is in:
<CD>
   /usr/lib64/perl5/5.10.0/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/CORE/libperl.so
</CD>

Why would you rename the library, instead of just creating a local perl version with its own directories? 

[warren]
Well patching isn't my expertise but I can give you the code that would
work. It may not be the simplest/cleanest way to do it.

<CD>
PERL_LIB=`$PERL -e 'use Config; $a= $Config{libperl};$a=~s/lib(.+)\.so/$1/; print $a;'`
PERL_LIBS=""-L$PERL_ARCHLIB/CORE -l$PERL_LIB""
</CD>

Why rename the lib? First the problem was a few years ago. That is when
I began to uniqify my perl library name. So the exact reason I really
don't remember. It had to do with a vendors product including their own
real old version to support their app. I am guessing when we used our
perl scripts, using a much newer perl, and mixed in library calls into
there application yjrough a perl module things got confused. Probably
the PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH could not be set to satisfy both things.

Why build my own perl? We have many users who all have a local
workstation. Managing the perl modules and updates on that many would be
insane. We have a single copy that they nfs mount. This give a single
point of updating for all and makes my life and theirs much nicer.

Also getting the IT department to let us modify the machines is near
impossible. The just don't understand engineers. or maybe they do:>)

[ellson] Sorry, can't use that.   Shared libraries do not have a .so extension on all platforms.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I know that there are very many edges, but in some weeks, I will have very bigger dot-file with about 1.000.000 edges.
So if you can fix it, it will be very helpful for me !
I think it is because my computer is a 32-bit one and I have too many nodes/edges for the int type.
Maybe (I am not sure) replacing the wrong int by long could help.

[erg]
Sorry, the problem is not (directly) in the size of your graph but in the size of the final image being produced.
It would appear that your final image would require more than 2^32 bytes.

Graphviz relies on libgd to produce jpg output. Thus, to get around this problem, you could:
- rebuild libgd on your machine to use 64 bit ints, then rebuild neato.

or
- use a non-bitmap format like postscript or SVG

or
- shrink your final drawing using the size attribute.

Try running just

  neato graph7-52600.dot > out.dot

The out.dot file will have a bb attribute indicating how large the drawing is in points.
You can then decide how much you would like to scale the drawing down, and run

  neato -n2 -T... -Gsize=...

to get the output format and size you want.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:04:36-04","2020-10-06 00:00:00.143-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] The only help I can offer is to suggest that this is a libtool problem.    First check that you
have a recent libtool installed, then if the problem still exists, report the problem to them.

   http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Are you positive you are using gcc and not an HP compiler?   I'm wondering about the ""cc""
in the libtool generated commands, and the ANSI complaints...  Check what compiler was
found in config.log.  Graphviz tries to use platform cc when available, but perhaps in this
case the use of gcc needs to be forced with:
<CD>
   ./configure CC=gcc
</CD>

[ellson] 
Brian is having problems compiling ltdl.c, not linking, and I don't think he is even using gcc

<CD>
   /bin/sh ./libtool --tag=CC    --mode=compile cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.       -c -o ltdl.lo ltdl.c
</CD>

Libtool is used as a wrapper to CC so it can add the right -fPIC, or whatever, magic
for the current compiler/platform to generate objects for use in shared libraries.

ltdl.c is code, supplied by libtool,  that we use in graphviz to dynamically load plugins.

[ellson] 

> Unfortunately gcc is the only C compiler that we have access to.  Have there been successful builds using gcc?  If so, is there any way I can acquire the plugin to do this? 
> Can you send your config.log

Also, try:

<CD>
   gcc --version
   cc --version
</CD>

just to be sure

Graphviz development builds are done using gcc, but we also build with Intel's icc and SGI's cc and Microsofts' Visual_C.

We build graphviz nightly on centos-4 using gcc-3.4.6  through to Fedora-Rawhide using gcc-4.3.1

Until about a month ago it was building nightly on Redhat-7 using gcc-2.9.6.  That system was just too old to support anymore

<br>

This makes dot crash (sometimes immediately, sometimes after a while):
note that the graph is planar (so it has a valid layout).
<br>

<br>

<CD>
digraph expression0 {
compound= true;
x; z;
subgraph cluster1 {a; b -> c; }
{ rank = same; c; a; }
}
</CD>
<br>

<br>

note also that if you move the ""ranksame"" directive inside the cluster, it works.
also dot prints the following diagnostic message:
<br>

<CD>
Warning: a was already in a rankset, ignored in cluster expression0
Warning: c was already in a rankset, ignored in cluster expression0
</CD>
<br>

This makes me think dot is ignoring the declaration of nodes a and c in the cluster and it's
trying to define them in the main graph, so when it processes the link b->c it goes in
access violation because c does not exist in its data structure.
as a cross proof, this works:
<br>

subgraph cluster1 { a; b -> d; c; }
<br>

a and c are somehow incorrectly removed from the cluster (but in the picture, they are in!);
since there's no edge that touches them, dot does not crash.
<br>

(I also deduce that the ranksame declaration CAN be positioned outside the subgraph)
<br>

<br>

<br>

Finally note that this variation:
<CD>
digraph expression0 {
compound= true;
x; z;

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[glenlow] I've added an exported_symbol flag to the ld invocation on Mac OS X in order to improve dead stripping and also prevent namespace collision when the binary plugins are used together with whatever installed pango, cairo etc. packages exist on the system. However as Emden pointed out, this flag doesn't work before Leopard. I've asked John to write some autoconfig magic to fix up the configure to detect this, and I'll use that to add or not add the flag to the plugin builds.

For now you can search for exported_symbol in the plugin Makefiles and edit it out manually.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:06:44-04","2021-05-29 00:06:25.174-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

This is a bug which we have to fix, but it is related to the many flat edges in your graph, induced by setting
constraint=false in most of your edges. Is this the effect you really want? If not, removing the constraint=false
attributes should allow the graph to be laid out.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:07:00-04","2021-03-21 00:00:02.346-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

This sucks badly ...or did I miss something?

[ellson] Well, I suspect that you missed something since both scaling and pagination are available as options,
but its a little hard to tell since you didn't attach a graph and command line that illustrates the problem.

[tcurdt] 
Well, I haven't been using the command line (but the osx app) and it's like that for any graph - so I didn't attach any particular one.
They are just as basic as they can be.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]
The error message comes from a gd interaction with freetype.   You  should probably recheck the
installation of gd, freetype and fontconfig first.

The other question is why is dot not using pango,  cairo,    which it should be in preference to gd.
Can you recheck those installs too, then rebuild graphviz.

If you still have problems, please send me a copy of your config.log

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I have a graph G where the ordering of the edges must be guranteed
<br>

Within this graph i wanted to add additional edges that should
visualize connections between nodes that should not have any
influence on the edge ordering of G.
This additional edges have the edge attributes
[weight=0,style=dotted,constraint=false]
to distinguish between the edges where the ordering should be preserved.
<br>

However, it seems that the result created by dot does not realiably
create the expected graphs. There are cases where the ordering of
edges is not preserved.
<br>

In my dot example one can see that the additional edge
1->8
destroys the ordering.
When removing the comment for the edge
1->12
the output is generated as i had expected.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

The generator for SVG output creates the following element:
```

 xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">
```
<br>

where the values for 330 and 290 depend on the size of the figure.
<br>

The problem is that the width and height values are in points, and
the viewbox values are in pixels, so this causes the figure to
be scaled with something other than 1:1.  As a result, the rendered
figure comes out larger than intended, and fonts are not in the
requested size.
<br>

Removing the ""pt"" specifier from the width and height attributes seems
to correct the problem.

VERSION: 2.18
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

If a graph (a digraph in my example) has both rankdir=LR and
landscape=true attributes set, the graph will draw downwards (as if the
graph has been rotated 90 degrees) and the output will either be very
dirty (not correct) or completely blank.  If the same DOT source is passed
to dotty or OmniGraffle, the graph draws correctly.  This has been
confirmed on Mac OS X 10.5 and recent Ubuntu and FreeBSD builds of
graphviz.  This can be worked around by removing the landscape attribute.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

// Produces blank (or corrupt) ""downward"" graph
digraph ""testgraph"" {
graph [ rankdir=LR, landscape=true ];
A -> B
}

// Produces correct graph as expected
digraph ""testgraph"" {
graph [ rankdir=LR ];
A -> B
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[elllson] The output of: ""dot -Tpng"" looks correct to me?  
<A HREF=""b1347.png"">(attached)</A>

The output of dotty looks like it is ignoring landscape=true since it is not rotated on the screen.
Not a big deal, since landscape mode is not particularly useful on a screen.   Its mostly intended for printing.

Using pygraphviz and django, I'm dynamically creating maps of the fiber in our company's datacenter. Each node (representing a device) has a URL to a detail page for that device, so I have to generate an image and put cmapx on top of it.
<br>

Most of the time it works fine, but sometimes, i'll get cases where the URLs will be far removed from where its corresponding node is on the graph, to the point where you have clickable regions out in the middle of nowhere and links on top of the nodes are nowhere to be found.
<br>

I don't know what commands were used, but I can say i'm using pygraphviz 3.5 and used the following commands in python to generate the graphs:

e.g.:
<br>

  layout neato

etc. Unfortunately, at least under Debian stable version there is no error
message, user trying to do ""layout NEATO"" just gets result for ""layout dot"".
(On the other hand, user gets proper error message in gv_tcl, including
list of possibilities: circo dot fdp neato nop nop1 nop2 twopi)

The problem is mainly with firefox, who don't care about the font-size.

[ellson] Perhaps you can use  -Tsvg:cairo  instead?     Cairo renders text as glyphs, and so totally ignores firefox's

<br>
1. D2222P1.dot used to create D2222P1.ps and D2222P1.pdf (2222 indicates 2 cm margins:
   The margins differ a lot. The top margin in pdf is much larger than in ps.
   <br>
2. D2222P4.dot used to create D2222P4.ps and D2222P4.pdf (P4 indicets 4 pages):
   When I open the pdf file with acrobat I get error like:
   (acroread:29074): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid uninstantiatable type `<invalid>' in cast to`GtkObject'

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Pleas place each (toplevel) subgraph cluster in its own group and/or layer for SVG output.
<br>

Each subgraph cluster with all its components like clusters, nodes and graphs (not edges going outside of the cluster) should be grouped.
<br>

Note that this is different than the layers already offered in dot.
<br>

Optionally such a group should reside in its own layer. Whereas all other elements should reside in the default layer.
<br>

Implementing this would easy post processing of the resulting SVG.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Allow setting width and height for subgraph cluster, overriding the calculated values.
<br>

When the supplied width or height is equal or larger than the calculated value, the cluster should be sized up to this value and positions for objects inside the cluster should be relatively scaled accordingly.
<br>

When the supplied width or height is less than the calculated value, a warning should be printed and the calculated value should be used.
<br>

Implementing this provides much more freedom to the user in managing subgraph cluster layout.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] This is during the step where ""dot -c"" attempts to load all available plugins in /usr/pkg/lib/graphviz/ and record the working ones into /usr/pkg/lib/graphviz/config.

Perhaps there is something in that directory that is inciting the crash (although dot is supposed to be robust to bad plugins at this stage).
Could you try ""rm -r /usr/pkg/lib/graphviz""  and reinstalling? 

[ellson] This looks like either a packaging problem, or a libltdl problem,  specific to NetBSD.

Are you the packager?

It doesn't look like a permissions problem, but can you check that when ""dot -c"" is run in ""make instll"" that it has
sufficient permissions to write to /usr/pkg/lib/graphviz/config

Is libltdl up to date?

Do you have a mixed x86_64 , i386 environment ?

After the failure, can you send me the result of ""ls -l /usr/pkg/lib/graphviz/\* /usr/pkg/lib/libgvc*""

This is not a bug fix.   Just a status update.

I've finally worked out how to convince pango+fontconfig+freetype to tell me what face, and font pathname it is actually using.

(ps) indicates the the fontname was recognized as a PostScript name and translated before being given to pango.
</CD>

There is clearly a problem recognizing Times-Roman variants.
The pango interface doesn't like '-'  (e.g. ""Times-Oblique"")

Also, from other testing, pango recognizes ""Times New Roman""  but not ""Times Roman""  (see below)

Unrecognized fonts seem to default to ""DejaVu Sans"".   You would think that ""Times Roman"" would fall back on Times, but it doesn't.

In plugin/pango/gvtextlayout_pango.c, after PostScript name translation, if any, the fontname is interpreted by pango-font-description-from-string()
which is described here:
   http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-Fonts.html#pango-font-description-from-string

---
## Creates a new font description from a string representation in the form ""[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]"", where FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated list of families optionally terminated by a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a     whitespace separated list of words where each WORD describes one of style, variant, weight, stretch, or gravity, and SIZE is a decimal number (size in points) or optionally followed by the unit modifier ""px"" for absolute size. Any one of the         options may be absent. If FAMILY-LIST is absent, then the family_name field of the resulting font description will be initialized to |NULL| http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-Standard-Macros.html#NULL:CAPS. If STYLE-OPTIONS is missing, then all style options will be set to the default values. If SIZE is missing, the size in the resulting font description will be set to 0.

(SIZE is ignored since it is over-ridden by dot's fontsize attribute.)

This syntax is NOT the same as fontconfig's syntax, which is described here:
   http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html
This is presumably because fontconfig is only one possible font-resolver backend for pango.  Other platforms can use something different.

I note that we can use fontnames like:
<CD>
   ""Times-Roman,Times,Serif,  Bold Italic"" resolved to: ""Nimbus Roman No9 L, Medium Italic""
</CD>
to give more reasonable fallbacks.

The postscript fontname translator can be usefully disabled by appending a "","" on the font-family name.  So the Times-Roman problem can be seen with:
<CD>
   ""Times-Roman,"" resolved to: ""DejaVu Sans, Book""
   ""Times Roman,"" resolved to: ""DejaVu Sans, Book""
</CD>
but ""Times New Roman,"" is ok:

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

It would be useful to output a multi-layer graph into a sequence of images (one per a layer).
In particular, this feature would allow to use output formats that do not support multi-page content.
<br>

Also, it would be also useful to have a command line option that specifies a particular layer for output.
<br>

Thanks,
Max
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson]
You can generate multiple layer images into any output format that allows multiple images.   At the moment this is -Tps
and -Tswf (if graphviz is built with libming).  I think SVG could support multiple pages, but thats not implemented yet.

-Tpng doesn't support multiple images in a single file, AFAIK.      Some possibilies:
<CD>
      - extend funtionality of -O to generate a uniquely named png image file for each layer.
      - add support for -Tmng
      - add support for the animated GIF format (what is it called?)
      - extend SVG support to multiple pages.
</CD>
All these options just require some coding.   All the hooks are in place at the plugin interface to provide layers to
any format that can handle them.

For now I recommend that you use -Tps for layered, or other multipage, graphs.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:02:50-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

A cluster-subgraph nested inside a subgraph does not have its box drawn.
<br>

In the attached example, it is desired to have nodes C, D, and tag all
appear on the same row, and also for there to be a box around C and D
(but not tag).  As best I can make sense of the manual, the construct
<CD>
  subgraph {
     rank=same;
     subgraph cluster0 {
         color=blue;
         C D;
     }
     tag;
  }
</CD>
<br>

should do what I want.  What actually happens is, C, D, tag are all
on the same row, but the box around C and D does not appear.  If I
take the ""subgraph cluster0"" out of the anonymous block, then the box
appears but ""tag"" is not put on the same row as C and D.  After
considerable messing around, I found that this construct produces
the output I want:
<br>

<CD>
  subgraph cluster0 { color=blue; C D; }
  subgraph { rank=same; D tag; }
</CD>
<br>

but only with an obnoxious warning:
<br>

Warning: D was already in a rankset, ignored in cluster _anonymous_0
<br>

At any rate, it seems a clear bug to me that a cluster-subgraph's
bounding box is not drawn just because it's nested inside another
subgraph.

<br>

I would like to have the ability to have subgraphs that are shaped like diamonds, rather than boxes.
The particular use-case I have in mind is a zoomable flowchart where clicking on the boxes expands them into box-shaped clusters, and clicking on the diamonds expands them into diamond-shaped clusters. So you could group up multiple diamonds into a single bigger diamond, and group up mixtures of boxes and diamonds into bigger boxes. Then each box and diamond can be expanded or compressed.

It would take a simple recursive search and replace of all ""include='file';"" with the content of the named file. Of course reporting errors on line numbers will have to take care of correct messaging (naming also the file).

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] That comes from a new language binding to R that I'm working on, but it is supposed to be disabled
in configure, so I don't understand why you are seeing this?

That relevant part of Makefile.am is in a ""if WITH_R"" conditional, which in config.status
should look like:
<CD>
   s,@WITH_R_TRUE@,|#_!!_#|#,g
   s,@WITH_R_FALSE@,|#_!!_#|,g
</CD>
i.e.  commenting out all lines related to WITH_R == true

The nightly build on the linux machines without R went ok last night.

[ryan] I have:

<CD>
s,@WITH_R_TRUE@,|#_!!_#|,g
s,@WITH_R_FALSE@,|#_!!_#|#,g
</CD>

So, the opposite of yours. My configure line is as follows, so I don't think I'm asking for R... maybe I should add some more --disable-foo switches.

<CD>
./configure \
--prefix=/foo \
--disable-static \
--with-expatincludedir=/foo/include \
--with-expatlibdir=/foo/lib \
--with-freetype=/foo \
--with-fontconfigincludedir=/foo/include/fontconfig \

Reported By: Keith Davies

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2007-11-23 07:09:39

OS: X86-LINUX-GENTOO

VERSION: 2.12
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Fonts are not found when trying to render a graph.
<br>

""Times New Roman"" and ""Times-Roman"" are both mapped to
""[internal times]"" according to
$ dot -v infile.dot -T png -o outfile.png
<br>

$ fc-match ""Times New Roman""
times.ttf: ""Times New Roman"" ""Normal""
<br>

$ fc-match Times-Roman
timR12.pcf.gz: ""Times"" ""Regular""
<br>

As far as I can tell, fontconfig can find fonts for these
font specifications.  dot seems to be _ignoring_ them.
<br>

I have observed this with graphviz 2.8 and 2.12.  2.6 is the last
version of graphviz I have seen work under gentoo.

## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

digraph G

  Root [label=""LLiiiiiiiiiiLL""]
}

// this is the same example as #1087.  Copied directly, in fact.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

This is evidently the same problem described in #1087.  #1087 is
marked 'fixed', despite, AFAICT, nothing having been done and
the _font found by fontconfig_ _not being used_.

Compiling this to any graphic format will show a strange loop and overlapping labels as long as the labels on the edges are longer than 30 characters.
Reducing the labels to 30 characters removes the overlapping.
Reducing the labels to 27 characters removes the strange loop.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm experiencing a core dump in the execution of the annexed .dot with
<br>

dot -Tps maingraph.dot > maingraph.ps |& tee maingraph.out
<br>

This is on a Linux machines, running either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 (CPU: 32bit) or Red Hat enterprise Linux 4 (CPU: 64bit).
<br>

Looking at the source, I've found the issue to be revealed in ns.c, but I can't delve into why there ctr != N_nodes.
<br>

The maingraph.dot is generated automatically, and it may have syntactic issues, but the parsing completed with no errors on my side, as you can see from the annexed .out, obtained with rhel4.
<br>

Hints?

dot's splines will occasionally cross over each other unnecessarily,
and will sometimes exhibit sharp bends.   Not sure if this is one or
two problems, but you can see them both on the same a->h edge in the

Other examples are the Interdata -> ""Unix/TS 3.0"" edge in crazy.dot
and edges at the 45deg corners in pgram.dot

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.14
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Even when using the -q flag, dot is not quiet and outputs messages,
at least when a font used in the graph is missing on the system.
<br>

e.g. I have a dot file (attached) using the Arial MS Unicode font, and it is not present
on a WinXP system I use, the following command:
<br>

dot -Tsvg -q input.dot -o output.svg
<br>

outputs the following message many times:
<br>

""Could not find/open font""
<br>

<br>

This is a problem when calling dot from Java's Runtime.exec() method as these cmd line
messages cause the method never to return.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

I'm trying to draw a singly linked circular list. The code below
works as expected, and puts the link from the 'tail' back to 'head'
nicely below the list. Switch se to ne and sw to nw for d -> a, now
the arrow goes nuts and criss-crosses the list. I would expect the
arrow to go above the list.

Tried a couple of variations, dropping the constraint=false, dropping
splines=true, none of them solves the problem.

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2007-10-17 20:34:51

OS: X86-LINUX-SUSE 10.0

VERSION: 2.14.1
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

File diffimg/diffimg.c line 119 is
`#ifdef HAVE_GD_JPEG`
<br>

and HAVE_GD_JPEG is defined so gdImageCreateFromJpeg is called.
<br>

File lib/gd/gd_jpeg.c line 37 is
`#ifdef HAVE_LIBJPEG`
<br>

and HAVE_LIBJPEG is not defined so the rest of the file, including
the definition of gdImageCreateFromJpeg, is skipped.  This eventually
results in a link time error.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

While tracking down the problem I deleted the .o file for gd_jpeg and was
surprised to see that no rebuild happened (a make clean) in the gd directory
was needed.
It would cause fewer surprised if the makefile included dependencies on
the .o files existing (in .libs)

[ellson] It may be that, if you have gd-2.0.34 or later installed on your system, that the internal libgd code isn't being used?

If there are missing dependencies its an automake, or libtool bug.   I suspect the problem is that the make target is the foo.lo, not .libs/foo.o.  Perhaps automake doesn't expect the user to poke in .libs.

I think there was a bug related to a missing #ifdef that I've already fixed in the 2.15 development series,
any chance you could try a recent snapshot from www.graphviz.org?

BTW,  jpeg is not a good format for line drawings due to is lossiness.     We've tested recently and the smallest images (not antialiased) are from -Tpng:gd 

[derek] > It may be that, if you have gd-2.0.34 or later installed on your system, that the internal libgd code isn't being used?

I may have 2.0.27 according to index.html in /usr/share/doc/packages/gd

There is a gd directory containing lots of stuff that came as part of
the graphviz download.

SEVERITY: MINOR

OS: _-_-*

VERSION: 2.9
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

If a graph has cycles, graphviz tries to break the cycles by reversing the edge. The code to do this seems to cause a memory leak.
<br>

This can be easily demostrated by replacing the create_test_graph function in dot.c with
<CD>

```
static graph_t *create_test_graph(void)
{
    Agnode_t *node[3];
    Agraph_t *g;
<br>

    g = agopen(""new_graph"", AGDIGRAPH);
<br>

    node[0] = agnode(g, ""0"");
    node[1] = agnode(g, ""1"");
    node[2] = agnode(g, ""2"");
<br>

    agedge(g, node[0], node[1]);
    agedge(g, node[1], node[2]);
    agedge(g, node[2], node[0]);
<br>

    return g;
}
```

</CD>
<br>

and then running it with the -m flag to observe the memory increase.
With the original create_test_graph, the memory foot print did not increase
<br>

I've compiled graphviz and dot with visual studio 2003 and 2005, both exhibit the same behaviour.
I've first detected it with my own modified version of graphviz, but later verified it with the stock development snapshot
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```

digraph example{
    a -> b -> c -> a
}

```
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

With the help of various tools, I've found out where this leak occurs exactly

it seems for each cycle in the graph it leaks 168 bytes per layout step
The exact location of the memory leak and call stack at that time is as follows:

VERSION: 2.9.20060719.0440
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hi,

   I am using graphviz-2.9.20060719.0440 .
   Before installing this I have installed tcl8.4.2, tk8.4.13, zlib-1.1.4, jpeg-6b, freetype-2.2.1 & libpng-1.2.5 properly.
   I have installed tcl8.4.2, tk8.4.13, zlib-1.1.4, jpeg-6b, & freetype-2.2.1 in the following way.
            ./configure --prefix=<install_dir>
             make install
<br>

   For libpng-1.2.5 I have used the following options.

```
           cd libpng-1.2.5
           cp scripts/makefile.linux .
           mane install prefix=<install_dir>
```

<br>

   Then I have installed graphviz-2.9.20060719.0440 in the following way.

```
          ./configure --disable-rpath --with-tclsh=<installdir>/bin/tclsh8.4 --with-wish=<install_dir>/bin/wish8.4
           --with-freetype=<install_dir> --with-zincludedir=<install_dir>/include/ --with-zlibdir=<install_dir>/lib
           --with-pngincludedir=<install_dir>/include/ --with-pnglibdir=<install_dir>/lib
           --with-jpegincludedir=<install_dir>include/ --with-jpeglibdir=<install_dir>lib
           --prefix=<install_dir>



          make install



    All the library files generated in this way will be automatically copied in the directory <install_dir>/lib/graphviz.
<br>

    Now I have created another independent directory called ""CurrentDir"" which has three sub directories.
          a) bin ( Here I have copied dot, dotty & lefty from <install_dir>/bin )
          b) lib ( Here I have copied all the library files from <install_dir>/lib )
        & c) scripts ( Here I have copied all the scripts from graphviz-2.9.20060719.0440/cmd/dotty ).
<br>

    Now I have renamed the <install_dir>. ( Otherwise the problem will not be visible )
<br>

    After that I have set the following environment variable.
          setenv PATH <CurrentDir>/scripts:$PATH
          setenv  LD_LIBRARY_PATH  <CurrentDir>/lib/graphviz:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
<br>

           Now going inside the <CurrentDir>/bin I am running dotty with the following command.
                     dotty abc.dot
<br>

           At  this time it is working  fine.
<br>

           Now the  directory graphviz is renamed to Linux2 & the environment variable  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to
                    setenv  LD_LIBRARY_PATH  <CurrentDir>/lib/Linux2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
<br>

     Now I am trying to load  the file abc.dot in the previous way ( dotty abc.dot ).
<br>

     It is giving the following error.
`         Error: Layout was not done.  Missing layout plugins?`
<br>

     But ldd dot gives the following informations
```

```
    libgvc.so.3 => <CurrentDir>/lib/Linux2/libgvc.so.3 (0x40017000)
    libgraph.so.3 => <CurrentDir>/lib/Linux2/libgraph.so.3 (0x4008a000)
    libcdt.so.3 => <CurrentDir>/lib/Linux2/libcdt.so.3 (0x40095000)
    libpathplan.so.3 => <CurrentDir>/lib/Linux2/libpathplan.so.3 (0x4009a000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib/tls/libm.so.6 (0x400b9000)
    libexpat.so.0 => /usr/lib/libexpat.so.0 (0x400dc000)
    libltdl.so.3 => /usr/lib/libltdl.so.3 (0x400fc000)
    libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x40103000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x40106000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
```

```

<br>

     Is there any way to remove this dependency ?
     Waiting for reply.
<br>

 Thanks & regards,
 Prantanu


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------


[ellson] Assuming <install_dir> was the same for freetype, fontconfig etc., all you should need for graphviz is:
   ./configure --prefix=<install_dir>

It automatically looks under <install_dir> for includes and libraries of its dependencies.

Why are you using --disable-rpath?    Take that off and you won't need to mess with LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Did you do a ""make install"" from graphviz?     ""dot -c"" is run with installation priviledges during
""make install"" to generate <install_dir>/lib/graphviz/config  which registers all the plugins.
The ""Missing layout plugins"" implies that this was not done.

If you rename the <install_dir> then you will break rpaths and the plugin load mechanism.  Just tell ./configure
where you really want to install it.

[north] Atrenta is a profit-making company that sells CAD software.
Their software is not freely available, as far as I can tell.

They should stop nagging us about problems of their own making.
We are not being paid by them to help them in their profit-making
activity.  If they need to take the time to understand how to configure
and install the software, that does not make the situation a ""major bug"".
I doubt that most software with intrinsic paths to find plugins or DSOs
can just be copied around anywhere.  If they want to do that Atrenta
should figure out how to build mostly-static binaries.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I ran into a strange problem with neato. I used the attached dot file to generate a jpeg: if I keep
the statement forcing the size
`graph [overlap=scale,ratio=fill,size=""6,6!""]`
I get one ugly image; without it neato seems to loops infinitelly and keeps on grabbing memory
(my ram occupation increased by 1.5GB) and I get nothing ..
Any ideas? Bad graph specification? (other similar specifications worked fine ..). It is a 'view'
of a NYTimes jobs rss feed where distances are calculated as the cosine distance between
the titles of each feed item (and points correspond to items).
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] It appears some type of overflow is occurring, related to having
an edge with len=0.00001.
The final stress is more than the initial stress, and negative stress
is reported.

Even when overflow doesn't occur, as in a small graph, having a small
edge len induces an extremely large initial stress value. It's unclear
why this is happening.

VERSION: 2.8
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

It seems that, when parsing URL string,
the web dot cgi-bin take only into account ""http://..."" URL and not
""https://"" ones.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[fabian] 
1. If I try to put an ""https://%s"" links in a node of the graph (URL argument), webdot is parsing badly the URL (see the dot file in attachment (AMI_3_2_0.dot)
And a consequence is that links on the graph are broken (AMI_3_2_0.dot.dot.map).
It is because webdot parse only URL starting with http://%s and not https://%s for the links. So if I put https://%s links, it considers that it is not a http://%s links and add the ""default"" server string to the URL.
I obtain then something like http://myserver:8080/https://.... which is bad.

2.A consequence of this is that if I try to put some links starting with http://%s in order to have good links, and then, if I create a graph on a an https://%s URL page:
If I click on a link from the graph, I will ""exit"" the https mode which is not what I want.

[north] I think he is saying that webdot (in TCL) does not know how to pull (download) graphs that
have a URL that begins with https not http.   Or, possibly, the name mangling that we do to
get clickable nodes is rewriting \N with a string that begins http, not https.  I'm not
sure, because the bug report was a little vague.  Maybe Fabian can comment further? 

[fabian] 

I have an HTML page at URL https://myserver.com where I put a webdot graph.
The webdot graph contains nodes and arrows. In each nodes, I put a web link (which is defined by the ""URL"" parameter in webdot language).
My problem is that if I define a node's  web link as ""https://anotherserver.com"", then webdot doesn't read correctly this link.

I solved partially the problem in the code (line 293)

INITIAL CODE
<CD>
###### 
# webdot::make_absolute_url
# 
# support routine for webdot::fix_graph_urls
# 
# returns: absolute_url
# 

proc webdot::make_absolute_url {serverport dirname ref name} {
   regsub -all {\N} $ref $name ref
-    if {[scan $ref {http://%s} .] != 1} {*
     if {[string first / $ref] == 0} {
         set ref http://$serverport$ref
     } {
         set ref http://$serverport$dirname/$ref
     }
  }
  return $ref
  }
  </CD>

As you see at the bold line, we go in the ""if"" only if we don't find a string ref beginning by ""http://"", else we return the ""$ref"".
That is why, if $ref=""https://anotherserver.com"", the function return something like http://myserver.com:8080/https://anotherserver.com which is bad;
While if $ref=""http://anotherserver.com"", the function http://anotherserver.com which is what I want.

That is why I changed the code as below :
PATCHED CODE

<CD>
###### 
# webdot::make_absolute_url
# 
# support routine for webdot::fix_graph_urls
# 
# returns: absolute_url
# 

proc webdot::make_absolute_url {serverport dirname ref name} {
   regsub -all {\N} $ref $name ref
- if {[scan $ref {http%s} .] != 1} {*
     if {[string first / $ref] == 0} {
         set ref http://$serverport$ref
     } {
         set ref http://$serverport$dirname/$ref
     }
  }
  return $ref
  }
  </CD>

It works, but there is several line in the code where problems like this are susceptible to appear.

[ellson]
An alternative change would be to use regexp:
<CD>
   if {[regexp {https?://.+} $ref] !=1} {
</CD>

It will still fail for other protocols, e.g. ftp://

I need to think more about this.   https: (or ftp:) cannot be used for all URLS
processed by webdot.  Specifically, any URL for which the webdot cgi is
the client can't be https because the client code in webdot has no support for anything but http.
(e.g. .dot files from an upstream server.)

I'm going to have to separate out those cases where https is allowed from those where it is not.

At least your patch works for you for now.

[fabian]
In my application, I can view pages by two different ways, http or https.
The only inconvenience of the patch is that if I display a page from an http URL, as my graph links are now ""https"", I switch from ""http"" to ""https"" each time I click on  them.
It is not really a problem but it is not very nice.

What will be nice would be to detect if the graph is called from an http or https page, and then to ""correct"" the graph links URL consequently.
I don't know if it is possible ? For now, as you said client can't be https because the client code in webdot has no support for anything but http.
Maybe a solution is to implement the https usecase for webdot so that if we start in https mode we stay in https and the same for http ?

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2006-03-08 17:46:40

OS: X86-LINUX-SUSE 9.3

VERSION: 2.8
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

The problem occurs for nodes when using DOT in two ways.
<br>

In all cases when peripheries is set to greater than 1,
eg. fsm.dot,
<br>

In many cases when skew, orientation or distortion are set to non-zero values,
eg. crazy.dot.
<br>

Nodes always have the correct size after the first layout.
However in the problem cases each subsequent call to gvFreeLayout
followed by gvLayout, causes the node to increase in size.
<br>

This does not happen for all nodes in crazy.dot,
and the effect varies for each node.
<br>

Perhaps gvFreeLayout is not clearing some fields concerned
with these attributes.
## STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```

        shape = polygon,
        sides = 4,
        fontname = ""Helvetica-Outline""

I know that people can use custom shape file such as:
""c:\component.png""
<br>

For example, but it's very unintuitive,
especially for large people, to draw complex UML diagrams,
while having to repeat on every line, the shapefile and such,
also the formatting within the box and arrow is tricky,
since one must use redundant spaces and returns
to achieve one's desired side-effect.
<br>

i.e. not having a label over the arrow
or outside the package box or component box
or under the user figure.
<br>

so it would be nice to have:

also having an attribute, such as:

My_Component   [shape=""plaintext"" color=""white"" shapefile=""c:\component.png"" label=""    My\n    Component"" ];
My_Package     [shape=""plaintext"" color=""white"" shapefile=""c:\Package.png""   label=""    My\n    Package"" ];
My_User        [shape=""plaintext"" color=""white"" shapefile=""c:\User.png""      label=""    End User"" ];
My_Database    [shape=""plaintext"" color=""white"" shapefile=""c:\Database.png""  label=""    My\n    Database"" ];
<br>

instead of simply:
<br>

My_Component   [shape=""component"" label=""    My\n    Component"" ];
My_Package     [shape=""package    label=""    My\n    Package"" ];

My_Database    [shape=""database""  label=""    My\n    Database"" ];
<br>

<br>

While, the remaining are not ""urgent"" for me,
they might be useful to other people...
<br>

<br>

shape=""nand""
shape=""nor""
<br>

with rank=same; and cluster trick would be awesome.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I've created a couple of graphs and exported them to Visual Thought files .vtx
<br>

When I try to read them with Visual Thought (Version 1.4 running on a Windows 2000 PC 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4), I get the following errors:

As you can see, these are quite different graphs, but give the same error at the same line - this points to me to a problem in the export syntax, independant of the graph itself.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

It is an important, critical actually, bug as, excellent as the graphing software is, there is a need to manipulate the output, which Visual Thought provides.

[ellson] Wow!  I wasn't aware that Visual Thought was still available.   I thought they had been bought by Etrade and
just disappeared.   Did you get your copy recently?   Is there are web site?

The syntax of ""points"" must have changed,  but I will need access to current Visual Thought documentation in
order to fix this.  If you have a copy, you could email the syntax for (points ....) to me, but there is no guarantee that this
is the only problem so I might need your help again.

BTW There are three other formats which can be edited:   SVG, FIG, and DIA.

VERSION: 2.9
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

If gv.layout is called an extra time between rendering an
       image and the associated image map in a gv_python script,
       the coordinated of the resulting image map will be skewed
       by a constant amount. Removing the extra layout or doing
       new renders of the image and the cmapx corrects the error.
<br>

The input gives the script I used to discover the problem
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] In general, one should never do another layout without first doing
a gvFreeLayout. In the best case, you're causing a significant memory leak.
In the worst case, the layout algorithms rely on fields in the data structures
being 0. If gvFreeLayout is not called, many fields will already be set,
which can cause a crash or a totally different layout.

Also, although not happening here, neato sometimes relies on a random number generator
for initial node placement. Thus, two layouts of the same graph might be totally 
different. This can even occur using a pipeline like

   cat x.dot x.dot | neato

where neato doesn't get a chance to reset the RNG.

[ellson]   I'd prefer not to expose memory management issues to the script
  interfaces, so I've just put in a change to CVS so that a gv.layout
  will first cleanup any previous layout.

[exec] There seem to be some memory leaks regarding relayouts. One of the
projects I'm involved in is a network traffic visualiser of sorts, and
in that application, we have very dynamic graphs where layouts change
at rapid rates - new nodes are introduced, old ones removed and so
on. The problem is that relayouts with current gv_python often results
in crashes.

I have not managed to create a simple test file that would demonstrate
you the crashes. However, while analysing the execution of a simpler
test script with the Valgrind debugging tools, I may have managed to
determine the probable cause of the crashes - Valgrind gave very
similar outputs for these crashes as to the test script. (Valgrind
detects memory management issues, and seems actually quite useful at
that.)

I'm attaching the <A HREF=b878a.py>test script</A> along with the 
<A HREF=b878.txt>report</A> I got from
Valgrind about the memory leaks it caused, along with the tool's
command line usage.

As the third <A HREF=b878a.txt>attachment</A>,
I include stack traces of the four different
core dumps I have managed to bring about with the network
visualisation tool in different contexts. All of the crashes seem to
be related and may have the same cause, which is possibly
gvFreeLayout. Hope you'll find them useful - if you have any trouble
with debugging this, I'll be glad to help if I can.

Just one more thing - the core dumps are taken from a build with all
compiler optimisations off (that was the source of the ""Source file is
more recent than executable."" warnings).

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I use the libgvc library in a GUI for a link-time program rewriter,
Diablo (Lancet) http://www.elis.ugent.be/diablo/?q=lancet_book
The control flow graphs of the functions in a program are shown and can be
navigated. We use gnomecanvas to actually draw the graphs, but the layout
is computed using the graphviz library. From our internal graphs we build
a graphviz-graph, compute a layout and then build a gnomecanvas graph to
display the result. A user can remove edges and nodes in the graph. In
some cases, when some of the nodes and incoming and outgoing edges are
deleted (using agdelete), gvFreeLayout crashes when it is called
afterwards. Not sure if we are using the lib in a wrong way, or if it is a bug.
I will give some relevant code snippets below, followed by valgrind output,
indicating where thing go wrong:

I've tried it with the 2.2 version as well.

[erg] There are two underlying parts in Graphviz: the basic graph library and the graph layout library
built on the former by adding additional fields to nodes, edges and graphs. Once a layout is done,
the additional fields contain, in addition to purely geometric and graphics information, pointers
to nodes, edges and graphs. When you use agdelete(), you remove the object using the basic graph
library. All the pointers to the object still exist in the layout fields of other. So when you
call gvFreeLayout(), it's going to access a node or edge that you've deleted, causing the crash.

For now, then, the answer is that you don't want to allow the graph to be modified before calling
gvFreeLayout(). If there is information from the layout you want to maintain, you'll have to make
a deep copy of it elsewhere. I guess the idea is that, if you're going to modify the graph, the
layout will no longer be valid, so free the layout first.

We'll have to consider whether this restriction can be loosened. Some of the auxiliary layout info
with graph object pointers could be freed after the layout is done, but not all. For example, the
layout info provides pointers to the clusters, which applications use in rendering. If these are still
around, it would be dangerous to modify the graph. Maybe we can provide versions of delete sensitive
to the additional layout information.

[ludo] thanks for your quick reply. I will be able to circumvent the problem by freeing the layout and recompute it afterwards. It would be nice though, if you're going to loosen the described restriction. In our case, it is undesired to recompute the layout because, when you're working with a graph and you are editing it (like removing nodes and so on) it would be confusing to change the layout each time. I could make a deep copy of the existing layout and call gvFreeLayout first, but then I loose the ability to export the graphs in some format to a file.
Nevertheless, I really like the graphviz project. If you think it is worthwile, you can list our project on the graphviz website.

VERSION: 2.7.20060108.0540
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

If I try to include bitmapped graphics in a node, via
either the node's shapefile option or an image tag inside
a table cell using the HTML-like labels, the bitmap
doesn't end up being included in the image when rendering
using cairo png output.
<br>

dot -Tpng foo.dot
<br>

It does work fine using dot's built-in renderer.
<br>

dot -Tpng:cg foo.dot
<br>

The nodes in the cairo rendering are the same correct
size, so Graphviz is making sufficient room for the
images. cairo just isn't including them somehow.
<br>

I tried including jpg, png and gif graphics in my graph;
none worked.
<br>

This is with cairo 1.0.2. I haven't used images in nodes
much before, and I haven't used cairo before the 2.7
snapshots, so I don't know when this problem crept in.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] Please send the .dot file that causes the problem.

What version info does ""dot -V"" show?

Where did you get RH7.1 rpms from?  Or was graphviz built locally from source?

The parser error above seems to indicate a problem before the keyword ""digraph"".
If your dot is very old it might not recognize the UTF8 BOM character (ByteOrderMark)
that later versions of dot can accept at the beginning of the file. 

[erg] I don't know if this has been resolved but another possibility, especially as the same dot and
file works for others in your machine, is to make sure that when a non-interactive shell is created,
no output is produced. Sometimes people have output-producing commands in a startup file like .profile
or .alias. The output gets into the pipe to the dot parser, which reports an error message. See, for
example,

I'm upgrading from 1.14 to 2.2, building from the CVS sources. I'm really
interested in the TopFish visualization technique, but also in just
laying out small graphs (up to 100 nodes), to understand the protein
interaction network in humans. GraphViz is still the best tool
I've come across for quickly laying out that kind of graph,
and allowing me to customization the decoration according to
various kinds of biological information.
I've been using graphviz for a number
of years (Stephen North even wrote us a letter of support for a grant
application a year or two back - that was in connection with
using graphviz to visualize multigraphs).
I'd be really glad to have some kind of fix.
<br>

I noticed from reading the earlier bug reports, that I'm not the only
one who encountered this problem. Like the previous user (bug #595),
I'm using gcc 2.95.x (x=4 in my case), I'm not really interested in upgrading,
so looking for a fix.

[north] Frank: topfish (er, topview) is not in graphviz, but we would
like to find academic partners who are interested in working
with it.  We can issue university (""non-commercial) licenses
but it's not open source.

With gcc problems, you might try compiling everything
without -O and if that does the trick, then figure out which
file in particular tickles the gcc bug.  I can't remember the
likely suspects any more (at least for neato; in dot it was
generally the spline fitting functions).
It's been a long time since I followed the area but there used
to be alternatives to gcc, such as lcc and of course if you
want to spend real money there's Comeau, Intel, etc.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] There appear to be two bugs here. First, and primarily, it would appear that something is amiss with
either the libgd or the fonts on your Sun machine. When dot can't find a font, it reverts to a handful
of built-in fonts. This looks like what you are getting in the output. When this happens, you 
should be getting an error message about the missing font. Is nothing being produced? What if you
run dot -v ?

The second, related bug is that, when dot reverts to the built-in fonts, it doesn't take into account
scaling factor, picking the same font as in the unscaled case. Since there are only 5 sizes available, the
scaling is never going to be perfect but it should be somewhat closer in your case.

[berend.ossevoort] o answer your questions, No I don't get any error messages and if I run:
dot example.dot -v -Tgif -o example_v.gif
This has the simular result as before (see example_v.gif) and the output looks also quite normal (see example_v.out)

I have observed the following issue with filled nodes in PostScript

There's a spurious 'nodecolor' before setting the fill colour, if the
(line) color attribute is passed, and there's a 'filled' which doesn't
actually do anything (see its definition):

gsave 10 dict begin

filled
0.000 1.000 1.000 nodecolor
0.000 1.000 1.000 nodecolor

but the spurious 'nodecolor' is not present if no (line) color
attribute is passed:

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] For some reason the libgd you are using isn't finding fontconfig.

Do you have fontconfig-devel installed?

If you are using the system version of libgd (probably, if your libgd is >=2.0.34 )  was it built with
fontconfig support?    (run: ""/usr/bin/gdlib-config --features"" and look for GD_FONTCONFIG)

Also check for freetype-devel and GD_FREETYPE

You shouldn't need  gd_alternate_fontlist()  if you have fontfconfig support, but I admit to being somewhat confused still about how you got this error since gd_alternate_fontlist() is provided in
plugin/gd/gvtextlayout_gd.c and referenced as an extern from plugin/gd/gvrender_gd.c in the same library.
The symbol should have been resolved internally to the library.

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

In a fairly complex (circa 100 nodes, 400 edges) of directed graph, I got the error message:
<br>

  Error: trouble in init_rank virtual 18 virtual 4 virtual 6 ...
<br>

Curiously, the error can be eliminated by changing the weighting on a particular edge 
<br>

""3.4.1.1"" -> ""3.4.1"" [label=""Step Back"", weight=7];
<br>

between 7 and 12. A number outside of these values causes the error to return.
Could it be that setting the weighting for the edge to particular values reduces (or possibly increases) the number of possible layouts/routes, such that it works or doesn't work?
<br>

Best regards

VERSION: 2.12
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I upgraded from an old version of Graphiz (don't know exact version number) to 2.12.
<br>

I noticed the following regression: Dotty no longer works.
<br>

Specifically, ""dotty unix2.dot"" fails.  First I get the following error message: ""dotty.lefty:"", then when I click OK I get the following error message: ""draw language parser error: 18"", then when I click OK I get the first error message again and so forth.
<br>

The unix2.dot file is unchanged between old version and 2.12, so this must be a regression to dotty.
<br>

Now, I read that dotty is on 'low development' and that's understandable, but something must have been changed that broke it?  Suggest reverting back to earlier version that can parse unix2.dot or maybe fix the newly introduced bug.
<br>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north] What version of Windows is this?  Windows Vista?

The latest development version of dotty works fine for me
(e.g. dotty unix2.dot)  on a Windows XP laptop.

[jl] I just double checked.  

This bug reproduces with 2.12 on both Windows XP and Windows Vista.  

The old version (that I do not have the exact version number of) does not
have this issue, neither on XP nor on Vista.

As a consequence: I do not believe that this is tied to a particular OS
version.

Would you mind trying to repro with graphviz-2.12.exe to see if you can
repro, please?

VERSION: GRAPPA 2006-10-10
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Grappa leaks memory and gets progressively slower when using the same Graph object to step through multiple graphs on a GrappaPanel.
The problem only occurs when there are default attributes set.
The cause seems to be the GrappaNexus observers which are registered for the default attributes but never removed.
The list of observers continually grows, and the removal of node-specific attributes becomes progressively slower.
<br>

The program below demonstrates the symptoms.
Within a minute speed has noticeably dropped and memory usage is continually increases.

<br>

I am trying to create a movie of a network as it grows. In order to do
this, I first go to the final form of the network and let neato figure
out the positions. Then I take these positions and use them in the
earlier stages of the network growth so that these positions will
remain fixed until the final frame of the movie.
<br>

To attempt to create the frames, I've used two commands:
<br>

1) neato -Tpng frame0100.dot -o frame0100.png
2) neato -Tpng frame0100.dot -n2 -o frame0100.png
<br>

In using command 1), I imposed the positions of the nodes by writing
them in the form pos=""x,y!"" where x,y are taken from the final frame,
in my case frame1000.

THE ERROR I get is:

Error: gdImageCreate returned NULL. Malloc problem?
<br>

which you have described in bug report number 904 probably being due to
an integer being larger than 231. I suspect this is true because I also
get the message:
<br>

neato: allocating a -1244933K PaletteColor GD image
<br>

It all makes sense given that at the beginning my network is small and
there's a lot of white around it, just like mentioned in report 904.
<br>

The issue is that I indeed need it to be this way until I've grown
the whole network to its final size in order to see how it grows.
<br>

I cannot share the network information without a major hassle since
there is information which requieres disclosures I do not approve.
<br>

I'd appreciate help. Thanks,

entered your bug report as a modification request. Rather than try to extend the format, we recommend that you create
dot language output, which obviously handles subgraphs. You can either parse this directly, use the parser in the

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When using Tcldot. After a graph has been created using tcldot it can be rendered once correctly but if it is then re-rendered if produces an error. (I am assuming that this type of re-rendering is actually allowed, perhaps this assumption is wrong) In real examples this has produced incorrect colours or even segmentation faults. In the provided example it gives the error:
<br>

<CD>
`tk_set_style: unsupported style box - ignoring`
<br>

In addition, the following produces a related error:
<br>

```

% $instg write $f gif
Warning: gd_set_style: unsupported style box - ignoring

<br>

Interestingly, changing the order of the definition of graph g1, i.e. setting the shape first and then the style, does not produce an error.

VERSION: 2.2.1
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Hi,
<br>

We need to make dot working with Arabic/Hebrew graphs.
When trying to generate PNG output file from an input UTF-8 file,
we found that the letter order was opposite (left-to-right instead
of right-to-left). I've tried to change the letter order manually,
expecting that the result will look as right-to-left word, but still
there is a problem: in Arabic letters in the word  must be connected
to each other, and in the output file they look separate.
<br>

I did not find any information about graphviz and right-to-left scripts in Web.
<br>

As far as I know, Windows knows to output right-to-left strings correctly.
The regular TextOut function knows to connect letters to each other.
It looks like GraphViz does not use TextOut, or uses it for each letter
separately, printing letters one by one.
<br>

Does somebody have any experience with right-to-left scripts?
<br>

Notes regarding the attached input/output files:
first word is in Arabic visual order (manually changed,
to make it look as right-to-left on screen),
second word is in Arabic logical order (normal in-memory order,
but looks incorrectly on screen - like left-to-right),
third and fourth words are sequences of Russian letters,
only for Unicode testing.
<br>

Thank you in advance.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] This is an area of internationalization that I knew we didn't support at the moment.
Also vertical text, like Chinese.

My plan is to use pango (http://www.pango.org/) for text layout, but this will take some development effort.
Pango is portable to Win32.

beautification purposes, using newlines to have them stacked one on
top of the other.
<br>

<br>

I found that in the normal portrait display this was displayed
correctly.  However, these newlines where ignored in the generated
postscript file (using the TCL [graphhandle write format]
functionality.) I found that the orientation did not appear to effect
the newline stripping here.  I also found that adding linefeed along
with carriage return did not seem to correct the problem
<br>

Moreover, a second problem I found was that when I change the GRAPHS
orientation to 'orient landscape' The displayed graph does not rotate
the labels, but it does adjust everything else by 90 degress.
However, the generated postscript is correct (except for the newline
problem listed above).

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

rpm of graphivz was a src.rpm and compiled on mandrake using

expat is 1.95.6-4

[erg] Your Isaviz is moderately large, so the layout is likely to take some time even on a fast machine.
For example, the layout took about 10 minutes on our fastest machine. You can trace the progress
by running dot -v. Also, with large graphs, a perfect layout is not so important. There are various
graphviz parameters you can set to truncate the various phases of the layout. In this case, almost
all of the time is spent reducing crossings.

There were no problems with expat in isv15675.dot. You might want to send along one of the
shorter graphs causing the expat problem, or file that as a separate bug report, so that we can see
what might be wrong.

Hi
<br>

We are facing some issues with the graphviz application.
<br>

Please find below the graphviz (http://graphviz.org ) application error message.
<br>
# 

<CD>
[root@saravana_graph tmp]# dot -Tpic 1.dot 1.ps

<br>

Input file
digraph G {
a -> b;
a -> x -> y -> z;
node28 -> {node29,node30,node31};
}
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] There are 3 problems here. First, there is the syntax error. Nodes in a subgraph do not use comma separators,
so your graph should just have

  node28 -> {node29,node30,node31};

Second, in the command

   dot -Tpic 1.dot 1.ps

is 1.ps meant to be the output file? If so, you need to use -o 1.ps.
Also, if the .ps subscript implies this is a postscript file, the appropriate -T option
is -Tps.

Third, it appears the config file for the graphviz plugins has not be created. This would
cause the message

  Error: Layout was not done. Missing layout plugins?

The simplest thing to try is running dot -c. This should create the file graphviz/config
under the library directory used for installation. Normally, this is done when you run

It appears to me that the build is trying to use 32-bit libraries and
is unable to link them along with 64-bit libraries when building 64-bit.
This behavior seems strange.

Do you have any suggestions?  We have a researcher who is researching

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Using the Sun Studio 11 C compiler on Solaris 8:

cc: Sun C 5.8 2005/10/13
<br>

I encounter the following ""identifier redeclared"" error during the build:
<br>

cc: acomp failed for sfexit.c
</CD>
<br>

It seems this bit of code is attempting to redefine exit with a different signature.  This is done within the lib/sfio directory.
<br>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] In any recent C environment, sfexit.c should basically be empty since
the atexit() function should be available with the system. Something must
be going wrong with how FEATURE/sfio is being generated.

[donald]
 I have three files for sfio in my graphviz-2.12 source directory:
<CD>
[lb9566@esdbdv  2:58PM ~/software/graphviz-2.12]% find . -name ""sfio""
./lib/sfio
./lib/sfio/features/sfio
./FEATURE/sfio
</CD>

I do not have a ./lib/sfio/FEATURE/sfio file.  My ./FEATURE/sfio file is empty. 

[erg] Sorry, I forgot that, in the released version, the sfio file is in ./FEATURE rather than in ./lib/sfio/FEATURE.

Anyway, the problem is that ./FEATURE/sfio is empty. When make is run in ./lib/sfio, one of the first things it
does is to generate the FEATURE/sfio file, which contains various #defines given system-dependent information.

You might try removing ./FEATURE/sfio and then cd to lib/sfio and run make again. Early in the process you should
see a command like

 ../../../iffe - set cc icc   : run  ../../../lib/sfio/features/sfio > ../../../FEATURE/sfio

Since FEATURE/sfio is being created, this line is probably being executed, but it may be failing for some reason.
You might try running it by hand. If you are in the lib/sfio directory, you can run

 ../../iffe - set cc icc : run features/sfio > ../../FEATURE/sfio

You may need to replace 'icc' with the value used by your make; this is just the C compiler being used on your machine.

If you see where the process is failing or if you see any error messages, please let us know.

[north]  John, do you agree here?

[ellson] I don't think so. This seems to be a difference between 
SuSE and Fedora build environments.

Tatu,

During 'rpmbuild --rebuild graphviz*src.rpm'  on Fedora, the 'dot -c' execution is supposed to be suppressed because $(DESTDIR)
is non-null.   The 'dot -c' is intented to be run only in the %post scripts from the binary rpms when they are installed
on the target machines.

I think what is needed is an improved test in src/cmd/makefile.am that works on SuSE.   I don't have a SuSE box to play on. Can you help with this?

SEVERITY: MAJOR

OS: _-_-WINXP

VERSION: 2.12
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

A ZGRViewer user reported that there was a problem with images used as node shapes.
I traced down the problem to the SVG output of dot.
<br>

The problem is different depending on the version of GV.
<br>

With 2.8, only half of the node images are displayed, namely those inside HTML tables. The
standalone ones declared through shapefile are not displayed at all (I checked the SVG
serialization, they are not declared at all). But those that are displayed are correctly located
w.r.t other elements in the graph. See [1] for a screen capture of the SVG rendering by
ZGRViewer.
<br>

For comparison, [2] shows the correct output obtained by asking dot to generate a PNG image
instead of an SVG document.
<br>

With 2.12, the SVG document contains all images, but as you can see in [3] there vertical
coordinate is inverted. This is the ZGRViewer rendering. When I try to look at this SVG
document in either Adobe Illustrator or Firefox, the images simply don't show at all.
<br>

The command lines used were :
<CD>
dot -Tsvg input.dot -o output.svg
dot -Tpng input.dot -o output.png

[erg] See also  b524. Turning off the NUMLOCK fixes the problem.

[James Coleman (jamesc dspsrv.com)] 
I also of course see this bug (solaris and cygwin).
I toggled num-lock and hey presto the menus work.
This behaviour is very puzzling and most new users would not find the very simple solution!

It should not matter about numlock.

dot version 2.2 (Wed Mar 23 14:44:07 UTC 2005)

        SFWgviz

both using cygwin as X server

I don't know X that well, but ...
Hmmm, well with truss -u (solaris - (truss -u a.out -u lib,libX*)) I can see that the menu is much quieter if numlock is on.
If mouse is scrolling in menu there is not X or user code activity.
If mouse is scrolling in menu with numlock off then there is activity (LOTS!).

Too much output to deal with but it would seem to be an X setup issue?
If numlock is on are the mouse events classed differently by X?
And are these event handlers not registered or initialised ... ?
Maybe a mask or flag at X App init time?

It needs VERSION defined. For building libgvc, libgraph we need to supply

-DVERSION

But this causes so much pain as we have whole slew of our libraries / binaries already in place and even though we do not include any files in many of them just because it needs to link with libgvc it needs to have -DVERSION and hence graphviz VERSION ends up screwing build of other libraries/binaries.

Make it GRAPHVIZ_VERSION or something. Such generic global names are recipe for disaster.

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2006-09-03 03:44:33

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.8
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When going to build graphviz, it fails because it cannot find the ruby library.
<br>

This is because configure assumes that you have compiled ruby with a shared library as opposed to a static one.
<br>

  RUBY_LIBS=""-L`$RUBY $TOP_DIR/config/config_ruby.rb lib` -lruby""
<br>

<br>

However, in my case, the library is _static_.  That means RUBY_LIBS should be:
<br>

RUBY_LIBS=""/usr/pubw/lib/libruby-static.a""
<br>

It would be most convenient to be able to pass this in as a variable to configure, either as something like:
<br>

--with-ruby-libs=</path/to/lib>
<br>

or an ac_ variable.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[ellson] I'm not saying that your suggestion isn't the right fix, but I'd like to understand the issue a bit better.

Why doesn't -lruby pick up libruby.a ?    Is it because both libruby.a and libruby.so are installed on the system and
the linker is preferring the .so ?   Or have you renamed libruby.a to libruby_static.a to avoid this issue?

Normally .a are built without -fPIC.   Why would this work when linked into a dynamically loadable ruby extension? 

[Quanah] 
I don't have a libruby.so, it is only built static.  Ruby _itself_ builds the static library as libruby-static.a, this was not renaming done on my end.

Original ID: 600
Reported By: Erik Saesarensen

SEVERITY: MINOR
Submitted: 2006-08-24 01:43:10

OS: _-_-

VERSION: 2.8
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

Edges with ""constraint=false"" seem have layout problems - in some cases, non-crossing paths are overlooked in favour of crossing paths.
In the actual example graph for which I noticed this, a 3-crossing path was chosen over a simpler non-crossing path for the same node layout - which can't be right.
A 4-node graph with the same clear problem (one unconstraining edge crosses another edge, even though there is a non-crossing solution with the same node placement) is attached.
<br>

After looking into the paper describing the overall algorithm used in dot, I got a hypothesis for the cause:
That the virtual nodes on the long, unconstraining edge are not taken into account in the min-cross phase.
From the code, that is indeed the case: those edges are given weights of zero (always).
<br>

But as far as I've understood, the 'constraint' attribute should just affect the ranking phase:
<CD>
   ""constraint=false causes an edge to be ignored for rank assignment.""
</CD>
whereas weights influence the later cross-reduction phase.
Hence, zeroing the weights is a bug.

<br>

When you generate a layout the head and tail labels often overlap and the connection points all come to the same place of the node, while in most generated diagrams there seems to be space enough to better spread the connection points and labels.
For us this is critical since it makes the diagrams often very difficult to interpret.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[north] Bert, this is not so much a bug as it is a missing feature.

If you know where to find good CPL-compatible code for
maintaining planar subdivisions with polys and splines
that would be helpful.  Maybe some kind of (throat clearing
here) simulated annealing code or constraint satisfaction
code could get the job done but right now we don't even
have a data structure that would ""know"" there is plenty
of space in which to move head and tail labels.

Hi,

I'm trying to get better quality images embedded in the graphs with the IMG tag and for higher resolutions (say 300 dpi instead of 72 dpi) the image appears too big in comparison to the graph.
Is there a way to control the ratio between image resolution and the drawn graph?
<br>

Note that scaling down the image is not an acceptable solution as I want to preserve the higher resolution for printing purposes.
I guess the only way would be to set the whole output image (I'm outputting pngs) to the resolution of the highest embedded image and draw the graph to an acceptable scale, but I couldn't find anything in the docs that indicates this is supported.
<br>

Any help appreciated.

the arrows connecting nodes r1 and r2 in the forward and

are ignored.  That's not completely a surprise, based on the
comment in Section 3.1 of ""Drawing Graphs with Dot"".  But after

better than what I've attached.  Most attempts are far worse,

dot seg faults, apparently depending on the length of the fontpath. I
first discovered this when I was trying to move my font directory from
one place to another. By luck, the first place had worked, but when I
moved it to another directory whose pathname was 2 bytes longer, dot seg
faulted. I tried fiddling with permissions and then with moving it
from place to place. I noticed that when the fontpath was a multiple
of 4 characters it seemed to work. Here's the smallest example I could
come up with that exhibited the problem. In this case I had made my
font directory a subdirectory of my working directory, and named it
'ttf' (which didn't work). I renamed it to 'ttf1' and it worked.

I can reproduce a 2-byte-per-iteration leak with 1.8.1 on Linux.

The leak is dependent on the form of the graph string in some
unclear way.  ""digraph G {A->B}"" does not leak, but ""digraph G 
{A;B;A->B}"" does.

Running under dmalloc shows the 2-byte leak, but it can't identify the
function (meaning the function wasn't in code built with dmalloc.h)
and the return address is invalid.

[erg] This is not a bug. There are newline characters within quoted

backslash before a newline, or the ""+"" string operator.

It turns out the original input file had introduced newline characters,
and user reported the problem in dot. It appears the problem is in dotty,
not dot. The new input file has a long line, which dotty rejects.

<br>

WRT the   style= dashed problem I was having.   I found that alot of the lines that were being drawn were not long enough to really exhibit their ""dashedness""  meaning I'd have less than one cycle of dashes in the length of the line.  I tried to switch to ""dotted"", but this appeared invisible to me.      I can't send you a chunk that exhibits this anymore because I've changed my code around to eliminate this problem, and don't have an example of the old output.
<br>

How about I just make a feature suggestion, which could add quite a bit of expressibility......
<br>

Could we have a two controls on a line's style.   One for the ""frequency"" of the dash, ideally something measured in points or some known absolute length.     btw the ""default"" should be such that the minimum length line in the overall graph as at least 3 cycles of dashes within it's length.
<br>

The second would be ""pattern"" and would be created by a sequence of numbers.  A simple 50% dash would be ""1,1""   a 33% dash would be ""1,3.""   If you wanted to get fancy, then something like ""1,1,1,3"" would appear as a double dash and then short blank spot.      ""1,1"" would be  good default.     also ""1,0"" could be a solid line  and ""0,1"" could be an invisible line.    There is nothing preventing a line line ""39,27""  or something equally goofy.  remember, these are for the relative pattern within a single dash period, and are not absolute lengths.

Thanks so much for great software!!!!

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I have some clusters and want to arrange them based on some nodes outside of them. The rank of the cluster can be adjusted by using the {rank=same;...} command. However, only a special order of rank commands works. In the following example, I have 3 clusters containing some random graph. Suppose the I want to adjust all of them with node K_2 in the outer cluster. If I use case1 or case3 in the example, all clustered will be placed at the top of the diagram. But if I use case2, it works. However, it works only if I set the rank of K_2 and the last cluster, then the last cluster and the one before, and so on.
The results are the same on both WindowsXP and Red Hat Linux 9.

SEVERITY: CRITICAL
Submitted: 2004-02-27 04:25:14

OS: X86-LINUX-5.0

VERSION: 1.11
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I've tried running neato to make some extremely basic graphs, with maybe 
fifteen nodes at the very most. Seemingly any minor problem in the .dot 
file or the command line would cause the entire server to freeze and require 
rebooting. Kernel logs showed nothing particularly abnormal going on with 
the system, and the problem is reproducible. For example, the following 
line causes the machine to freeze, I believe because 10.5 may be an invalid 
value for the size parameter:
<br>

/usr/local/graphviz/bin/neato -Goverlap=scale -Gcenter -Gsize=8,10.5 -Tps2
<br>

Still, it shouldn't freeze the whole server--just an error would be nice.
<br>

Using the -Goverlap=false parameter would also cause the server to lock up.
<br>

This is a Cobalt RaQ 3i running on a 300MHz AMD K6-2 processor, so it's not 
the most powerful system in the world. Nevertheless, the times that it 
froze did not involve particularly complex graphs. Another time, 
forgetting a } at the end of a .dot file caused it to lock up completely. 
Is there any sort of error checking for proper syntax before the files 
are parsed?
<br>

Thanks for your help!

I was up late last night trying to repair my system after trying (and failing) to upgrade glibc and gcc. Then, I noticed something interesting: even the ""broken"" version of graphviz (the one compiled after I applied all of those patches) never seemed to fail when I used the most basic command structure with very few parameters. So, today, I tried adding the parameters one by one, and it seems that the problem is isolated in -Goverlap=scale. I ran all of the others twenty times each with no problem, adding a new parameter for each cycle. Once I added -Goverlap=scale, it failed on the second time and rebooted. 
The <A HREF=b408a.txt>log</A> is attached.

For a strict, undirected graph, I thought using agedge in a subgraph
when the edge exists would be similar to aginsert. However, in
the example below, ep is a different object from e. Assuming the
semantics are like libagraph, with the edges being different but
representing the same abstract edge, I tried setting the color attribute,
but clearly ep and e have separate attributes. Also, if 
comment line A and uncomment line B, we find that the root graph has
two edges between the nodes, which one wouldn't expect in a strict,

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

this build might be four months old. It's a graph from a graph bipartitioning problem outputted by some genetic algorithm I wrote. It's this big because the professor made it that way and it isn't strange it's that big these problems are this big. Now I would like to plead for fixin'the bug because actually graph bipartitioning and graph n-partitioning problems are quite common in probabilistic reasoning and therefore also in probabilistic computing. It would indeed be of great assistance in many tasks if some sort of visualisation of the material existed. nah mean? For debugging purposes as well as experimental analysis this would be very important. flags tried -Tpng -Tps and also no flags at all dot just hangs I guess. I would like to add I really like dot and I would like to contribute by writing a c++ wrapper class for dot would it not be the case that I have not been able to compile dot at all... I asked questions one time when I was experimenting with mingw but I was to
 ld cygwin was the only way. The only reason cygwin does in fact not work is besause the system header file (I think)system.h and some system timing (it were indeed the headers incorporating info about cpu timing)headers are not at all present in mingw. If it is possible I would like to know what purpose they serve in current implementations of dot.

the file says dottybug but dot hung, and caused dotty to hang , i tried independantly.

VERSION: 1.10
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

I'm trying to let dot (or neato) draw a graph similar to the one on
""http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/examples/directed/datastruct.html"".
But even when using the dot file on that page (after repairing the
multiline labels), dot aims the ends of the edges at the center of the
target port, not at the node boundary.
<br>

If you examine the 0xf7fc4380 node port on the left (the one pointed to
by 0x10ba8), you'll see that the arrows are within the node. On the
sample page, they point to the node boundary instead.
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] The change occurred before June, 2003. This is actually an
artifact of the whole layout changing, so that the edge now passes
through the node on its way to the port. This is the current implementation.
dot does not guarantee edges to ports will not go through the node, 
especially as the port may be entirely surrounded by other ports.

We could provide this feature, or implement ports on ports.

Also, as noted by the submitter, the sample dot files have line breaks
in the middle of quoted strings, which means one can't run dot on
them without first fixing the lines.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:06:26-04","2021-04-12 00:06:45.399-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] The algorithm used by neato requires it to solve an optimization problem
that is very sensitive to the initial layout chosen at random. Sometimes
the initial layout causes the algorithm to find a local minimum that it
can't get out of. That is what you are seeing.

The simplest solution is to rerun neato, but use a different initial
layout. This can be done by using -Gstart=<i>, where <i> is any
integer not equal to 1. -Gstart=regular or -Gstart=x should also work.

This is somewhere between a bug and a request. There are randomization
techniques to help push a solution out of a local minimum. We could
add these to neato.

Original ID: 261
Reported By: Laurent Cocea

SEVERITY: MAJOR
Submitted: 2003-08-05 04:40:24

OS: X86-LINUX-RH 6.2

VERSION: 1.10 (BUILD 2003.07.31)
## DESCRIPTION

<br>

When edges are drawn first, with the -Goutputorder=edgesfirst option,
edge head and tail URLs appear to be inactive. According to the online
graphviz documentation, ""For edges, the active areas are small circles
where the edge contacts its head and tail nodes. These areas may
overlap the related node, and the edge URL dominates."" It appears that,
with edges drawn first, edge URLs that overlap the related node no
longer dominate and the active node URL area overlaps arrowhead areas.
<br>

The attached screenshot represents an area in neato output generated
without the -Goutputorder=edgesfirst option; the result is, some edges
are drawn over the nodes. Small circles (arrowheads of `odot' type) at
edge/node junctions have links attached using edgeURL and tailURL
parameters. When these circles are clicked, the corresponding URL is
displayed in a pop-up window.
<br>

Upon invoking neato with the -Goutputorder=edgesfirst option, the
small circles are visible but clicking them opens the related node
URL rather the expected headURL/tailURL, as if the node URL dominates
even in areas that are strictly outside the contour of the ellipse
(node shape).
<br>

The files <A HREF=""b335.pdf"">b335.pdf</A> and 
<A HREF=""b335a.pdf"">b335a.pdf</A> show the ouput, converted to 
PDF format, generated with and without, respectively, the
-Goutputoption=edgesfirst option. Notice the difference when you click,
or simply show URLs by moving the mouse over, any small circle
(""arrowhead"") adjacent to the VAV node in the two .pdf documents.
<br>

The VAV node example in b335.pdf
is particularly relevant as only the small circle at the bottom of
the VAV node shape displays the correct URL, likely because it's outside
the rectangular area associated with the node URL. The other four small
circles adjacent to the VAV node link to the node URL rather than to
their associated head/tail URLs, which can be displayed in b335a.pdf.
<br>

The base URL of all nodes is www.ncbi.nih.gov while the base URL of all
small circles (head/tail arrowheads) is dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu.
<br>
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

IMO, when edges are drawn first with the -Goutputorder=edgesfirst
option, edge arrowheads and associated URL areas should be drawn last
(after the nodes are drawn). This may ensure that headURL and tailURL
links ""dominate"" the related node URL.

/user_shape_0 {%%BeginDocument:

[north] I believe all %% headers have to be stripped out
of the EPSF (or, better, munged somehow) since obviously
they do not correctly apply to the containing Postscript document.
This is a new bug because some earnest contributor recently
improved the code by undoing the comment stripping in the
EPSF shape loader (""hey, memory and disk are cheap now!"")
Feel free to contribute an appropriate improvement here.

[erg] See also bug b344
Even if you remove all of the %% headers, it still fails. It appears
there are operations in the eps file which cannot be wrapped into
a function?

Or run gpr and delete the invis edges.

The use of invis edges to achieve various effects

Upon further reflection I can see your point (though saying ""should not

But we might as well add 100 other potential TODO items as ""bugs"".
You're talking about a fairly major overhaul of a bunch of code that is
really too fragile to tweak easily.

when some nodes' properties  are changes using ""set attr"" popup

execution. For example, if we set ""shape=circle"" for a ellipse shaped node,
the node becomes a circle only after a ""do layout"".
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[erg] To do a circle correctly, the graph needs to be laid out again,
to get the correct node size and allow for adjacent ranks to move. 
Since dotty relies on the batch program dot for layout, it only does a
layout when the user asks for it. Presumably, the dotty scripts could
be changed to do a layout whenever an attribute change occurs.

Alternatively, the file dotty_draw.lefty in lib/lefty can be changed
as shown. This may produce, however, a circle too large (or if '>' is
changed to ',', a circle too small).

## DESCRIPTION

<br>

It is very nice, that dot issues warnings
(eg. for meaningless lhead/ltail references).
But it might be even more helpful if they
were accompanied by a line number.
<br>

By the way: it is in general a good thing that dot automatically
inserts a node ""x"" by default if it is referenced
in an edge ""x -> y"" and ""x"" has not been declared before.
But sometimes a typo might be involved so that an unintended
edge is created! This case might be difficult to spot
in a large graph.
The ""declare before use"" paradigm served a purpose
in programming languages, so maybe it is useful in
this case too.
So I suggest to introduce a command line option that
warns if an edge references an (previously?) unseen node.
What do you think?
## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Thank you very much in advance.
This is really a great tool to work with.

[erg] Line numbers on warnings will involve code change. We could
decide to maintain line numbers in the graph, but because nodes
and edges can be used multiple times, line numbers would also have
to be attached to attributes. Alternatively, moving the check to
the parser wouldn't work in general, because the use of ltail
or lhead in an edge may precede the definition of the cluster.

As for providing stricter checking, this could be helpful. Other
possible checks would be for multiple edge expressions for the same
edge, and reporting attributes or values unrecognized by graphviz.
This last would probably be most helpful if it checked specifically
for attributes close to a known attribute or value, to pick up
potential misspellings.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-07-04 00:03:49-04","2021-03-17 00:03:00.189-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

<br>

With edge concentration on dot drops a cyclic edge between two vertices
in a cycle.

In previous versions (1.7.x releases) this was rendered correctly as a
bidirectional edge between the vertices. In 1.8 (1.8.5 and
1.8.9 were tested) the edge is rendered as a one-way arrow. Turning off
concentration eliminates the issue.

Compared to older versions (e.g. 1.7.6), when I use 'arrowtail = dot', the dot is much larger, and when I'm using a port within a record as the tail of the edge, it ends up covering up some of the text.

It looks like concentrate might use a zero-sized floating node for the branch point?   Can this type of node be exposed in the dot language?

It sits at this last line for as long as I have the patience to wait

but we are addicted to xdot output, because we use it to draw our graphs

Any suggestions? (other than me checking out the GitHub repo and seeing
what has got its knickers in a knot).  I put the graph in question here:

1173,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1173","[Dot] ""Error: trouble in init_rank"" puzzle finally solved!","*Created by: ens-lg4*

Dear GraphViz developers,

We were migrating our software that uses ""dot"" for graph generation to another RedHat Linux machine. I was puzzled by the fact that the same code behaved differently on two computers, although we made sure all the installed packages/libraries were the same. The same version of ""dot"" (actually the same binary living on a shared mounted filesystem) with the same input file was working fine on one computer and throwing the infamous ""trouble in init_rank"" error on another.

Today we finally tracked it down to a single culprit: the availability of Type1 fonts in /usr/share/fonts/ !
There is a clear 100% correlation: adding the files solves the problem, removing the files causes the ""trouble in init_rank"" kind of crash.

Apparently, before laying out the graph ""dot"" uses (possibly indirectly, via png/svg libraries?) system's font files to estimate sizes of text-containing elements. For some reason, the failure to find those files is not properly caught/reported, but the missing data somehow causes that ""trouble in init_rank"".

It was very confusing that for smaller graphs there was no crash. Probably, this dependence on font files is masked by some other, stronger conditions.

The same behaviour has been seen in ""dot"" versions from 2.28.0 through 2.38.0 (under Ubuntu and RedHat). The test file has been attached. To replicate you can either move files out of and back into /usr/share/fonts or simply change font paths in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf to temporarily mask the actual font files.

Thank you in advance for looking into this!

1188,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1188","Expose cgraph macros as functions in dll api","*Created by: Chiel92*

For some cgraph functionality, macros are provided in stead of functions, I suppose for reasons of performance, as this reduces function call overhead. Examples of this are `aghead` and `ageqedge`.

When programming in C or C++ this doesn't really make a difference, but when using the cgraph dll from a language without a C preprocessor, you can't use macros. Now in the case of `aghead`, there is a function definition given in `graph.c`, which can be used instead of the macro. I.e. you can link against `aghead` and it will just work. *My question is: is this intentional?*

If yes, I would like to do the same for `ageqedge`. If not, I would like to introduce this, albeit in a slightly different way. It'd be more clear if these macro-alternative-functions were declared in `cgraph.h`. You would then be able to choose between either interface by a preprocessor directive.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2016-12-20 00:03:23-05",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

A few days ago you uploaded a file named graphviz-2.40.20161221.0239.tar.gz on [the source download page](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php). ""2.40.20161221.0239"" is an unusual version number; it's of the form you have previously only used for development versions, not stable versions. Is this change in version numbering strategy intentional? The ChangeLog file included in that tarball calls the release ""2.40.0"" instead. Which is correct?

Either way, there is no tag or release for this version on this GitHub repository; please create both a tag and a release for whichever version number is the correct one.

dump1.dot:

	node [label=""\N""];
	xx -> xxx [key=1];

Hey there,

The attached example .dot file crashes dot in dotsplines.c, line 1301 - ED_label(auxe)
ends up being 0, and ED_label(auxe)->pos predictably segfaults.

According to valgrind, an invalid write8 happens previously, in line 1231. I am unfortunately
too unfamiliar with all the macros in the codebase to judge exactly what is going on, but it
appears that cloneEdge does not work as expected. There are a few lines of code commented
out w/o further details - perhaps they are the culprit?

Is there a way to get dot to leave nodes in the graph in which they're declared rather than in some subgraph? In particular, I'm seeing that if the only outgoing edges for a given ""source node"" land in a subgraph, then the source node itself gets placed in that subgraph rather than the parent graph that declares the source node.

I stumbled onto a workaround: wrap *every* node in its own cluster subgraph. This practice somehow avoids the wandering node problem, but the resulting layouts are not as nice looking.

I followed the following procedure (from [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34228395/ubuntu-graphviz-sfdp-not-working/42579735)):

1. run `sudo apt install libgts-dev`

3. run `sudo pkg-config --cflags gts`
4. Download `graphviz-2.40.1.tar.gz` from [here](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php)
5. Extract and run `sudo ./configure --with-gts  --prefix ~` in the folder
6. Run `sudo make` in the folder
7. Run `sudo make install` in the folder

After doing that I can successfully use some commands (dot, fdp), but not others (sfdp, neato). I get `/usr/bin/sfdp: No such file or directory` when trying to use `sfdp`, for example.

Some behavior seemed to change with get_edge(), between version 2.38 and 2.39.  Specifically, if I pass a key to get_edge() (which also gets passed as the ""name"" argument to agedge()) with version 2.39, it returns an edge, even if the key/name doesn't match.  In 2.38 the same call would return KeyError.  Of course, the latter is the expected/desired behavior.

Here is the pygraphviz code to reproduce it:

Hi,

I've noticed a bug in recent versions of Graphviz where certain edges are being routed through nodes, even in cases where a more optimal (without any edge-node-crossings) routing seems to be available.

This error seems to have been introduced some time after version 2.38.0 of Graphviz, since that version produces desirable edge routings for me while more recent versions (the oldest version I've observed with this problem is version 2.39.20160727.0821, but I haven't done a lot of testing on versions) produce ""undesirable"" edge routings.

For reference, I've enclosed the DOT file for a graph which exhibits this problem at the end of this post.
Running `dot` (Graphviz version 2.39.20160727.0821) on the enclosed graph produces the following drawing, with edge crossings through nodes c_B20_142_198_17, -35, 206, and -4:

Running `dot` (Graphviz version 2.38.0) on the enclosed graph, however, produces the following (with no edge-node crossings) drawing:

The problem is in pango_textlayout() where it is setting the font options. Instead of specifying the font options, you should  call pango_cairo_update_context() with the cairo content. Pango will pickup the default font options for the surface which for PDF/PS is hint style and metrics off. Also, setting the subpixel order manually is wrong. If pango_cairo_update_context() is used it will detect the subpixel order for the display used.

(The details of the transaction processing environment are not relevant here.)

I'm reasonably pleased with the results:

[cpattl-pie.dot.pdf](/uploads/569540b6b037a08b27f67c7f70283a1c/cpattl-pie.dot.pdf)

source: [cpattl-pie.dot](/uploads/85243ab6148e2d9738b73319cf549596/cpattl-pie.dot)

but I'd like to improve some specific aspects of the dot layout.

In particular, I don't like the way ""inter-region"" calls (dashed edges) are ""swept sideways"". I don't like it for two reasons:

* It causes those edges to bunch up.

* I'd prefer those edges to flow in the same direction as ""intra-region"" calls (solid edges).

Switching rank direction doesn't make the problem go away: the inter-region calls ""plummet downwards"" instead.

I chose `splines=ortho` because the default `splines=true` results in an unreadable bundle of curved edges passing sideways from the original region to other regions.

I'd prefer it if the rank direction and position of the regions (clusters) enabled intra- and inter-region calls to flow in the same direction, similar to this simplified version that I drew manually in PowerPoint:

[cpattl-nopie-drawn-manually.pdf](/uploads/0c4a15dc0f95b789e00e49650ed2f73d/cpattl-nopie-drawn-manually.pdf)

(I realize that this manually drawn effort contains some more-or-less arbitrary variations in edge direction; when I drew it, I wasn't thinking of using it as an example of what I wanted a programmatically generated diagram to look like.)

I don't know how to achieve that in a DOT file, or even if it's possible. I believe that I cannot directly specify the position of the clusters, because that is determined by the position of their subordinate nodes. And I don't know how to position those subordinate nodes to achieve the layout I want: side-by-side clusters with sideways-flowing edges.

I'd welcome advice on improving the layout of this diagram.

* `docker run -it image_id_from_docker_build`

From another terminal, outside the container:
`docker cp /path/to/attached/reproducer running_container_hostname:/fuzzing/reproducer`
(reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)

And, back inside the container:
`/fuzzing/repro.sh /fuzzing/reproducer`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

1311,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1311","OOB Read in left2right - 71467735","Hello graphviz team,

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master bd97cff688f7a7b85b6f1262e14eb1cac0862fcd).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

TL;DR instructions:
* `mkdir project`
* `cp Dockerfile /path/to/project`
* `docker build --no-cache /path/to/project`
* `docker run -it image_id_from_docker_build`

From another terminal, outside the container:
`docker cp /path/to/attached/reproducer running_container_hostname:/fuzzing/reproducer`
(reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)

And, back inside the container:
`/fuzzing/repro.sh /fuzzing/reproducer`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

Pies are nice, but there are times when I'd prefer donuts.

(Aside: Dear GitLab CSS developer: could you please reconsider your choice of color for inline code snippets? I associate `red` with `errors`. Then again, I have a similar gripe with the default theme of the Prism syntax highlighter. Just me?)

I've read the [FAQ item on custom shapes](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/faq/#FaqCustShape), but I'm still uncertain of the best way to proceed. Start with the circle definition?

As an alternative to a custom node shape in Graphviz, I'm also considering post-processing the Graphiz-generated SVG: ""punching a hole"" in the pies, using JavaScript to insert `<ellipse>` elements with smaller radii. While less elegant than a custom node shape in Graphviz, this is probably the easiest option for my primary ""in-browser"" use case (using [d3-graphviz](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz)). Thankfully, the Graphviz-generated SVG for `node [shape=circle, style=wedged]` contains an unfilled transparent-stroke ellipse for each pie on which I can base the ""holes"" (smaller ellipses); punching the holes would be more difficult if the SVG contained only the wedge paths.

I'm still working out the details of the best way to calculate (relative to the pie), or otherwise parameterize, the size of the hole.

Advice, recommendations welcome.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2018-01-03 00:00:31.841-05",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master bd97cff688f7a7b85b6f1262e14eb1cac0862fcd).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

TL;DR instructions:
* `mkdir project`
* `cp Dockerfile /path/to/project`
* `docker build --no-cache /path/to/project`
* `docker run -it image_id_from_docker_build`

From another terminal, outside the container:
`docker cp /path/to/attached/reproducer running_container_hostname:/fuzzing/reproducer`
(reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)

And, back inside the container:
`/fuzzing/repro.sh /fuzzing/reproducer`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

1319,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1319","Problem with fragment identifiers (ID) for svg graphs","Hello,

When generating svg images with id and href, it is impossible to scroll to the right location in the svg image because of the following mechanism (function emit_page in lib/common/emit.c):

- First, the code generates the &lt;g id=""a_ID""> label (calling svg_begin_anchor in file gvrender_core_svg.c)
- Then it generates the &lt;a href=""URL""> label inside the previous g
- Inside the previous a, it generates the background (using the function emit_background in lib/common/emit.c that calls gvrender_box in render.c)
- Inside the a, it generates the label itself (emit_label in lib/common/labels.c).

The problem is that there are no coordinates given for the label g that contains the id, given that all coordinates are located in the background box and the label itself. Hence, when going to myfile.svg#a_ID, the browser is not able to determine where it is.

One solution (in the common files) would be to change the way the anchor is generated resulting in the id attribute being written inside the emit_label function. This would require some changes in the prototype of the functions (so that it could be possible to pass an id to emit_label). In this case, the id attribute would be directly tied to the coordinates x and y of the label and not put on top of it. 
Another solution (this time in the svg render core) would be to replace the &lt;g> label by a &lt;text text-anchor=""start"" x=""XXXX"" y=""YYYY"" id=""a_ID"" fill=""none"">a_ID</text> that would allow giving coordinates along the id (note https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1431446 and crbug.com/803440 ).

graph.dot must contain the following (minimal) graph structure to reproduce the bug:

```
digraph {

As seen in the tracelog below, the error is raised when dot tries to load an image into the graph. The error takes place in libgvplugin_quartz when embedding some-image.png in the resulting graph PNG using gvloadimage_quartz:

Source code: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/blob/master/plugin/quartz/gvloadimage_quartz.c at line 130.

Upgrading Graphviz, Quartz or Mac OS does not seem to have any effect, so the question is: why does this error occur and how to fix it? Is the error caused by me or is this a bug in Graphviz or Mac OS?

1328,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1328","Heap Out-Of-Bounds Memory Access (72564921)","Hello graphviz team,

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master bd97cff688f7a7b85b6f1262e14eb1cac0862fcd).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

TL;DR instructions:
* `mkdir project`
* `cp Dockerfile.graphviz /path/to/project/Dockerfile`
* `docker build --no-cache /path/to/project`
* `docker run -it image_id_from_docker_build`

From another terminal, outside the container:
`docker cp /path/to/attached/reproducer running_container_hostname:/fuzzing/reproducer`
(reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)

And, back inside the container:
`/fuzzing/repro.sh /fuzzing/reproducer`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

These nodes are not visible but the space for them is still allocated in the graph so the graph is bigger then it should be. So I set zero dimensions for these invisible nodes (`height = 0, width = 0`). Then the _dot_ command print warning that 

> Warning: node '__MW', graph 'example' size too small for label

So I added empty label (`label = """"`) and it works well.
But when I modify the dot file by _unflatten_, then empty labels are removed and warnings are back.
I think _unflatten_ should keep empty labels in the dot source code.

There is a simplified test case. Notice that the label is missing in the unflatten output.

I have an external program generating automatically directed acyclic graphs for dot program.
Right now they are rendered like the following:

![graphviz_ori.svg](/uploads/241525fbde07eada2aea5b709c02435a/graphviz_ori.svg)

Instead I would like to have a graph where at the bottom you will find only leaf nodes. Then, just above, only nodes pointing only to leaf nodes. Then, just above, only nodes pointing only on nodes that have been already defined in the previous steps. And so on...

For the above graph the result would look like:

![graphviz_new.svg](/uploads/183ac2a0bad5018930448e45c01714e0/graphviz_new.svg)

Is there currently a way to have this result using current Graphviz options (without having to manually specify the rank in the dot file)?
If that is not the case would you consider this as a possible enhancement?

1340,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1340","Cairo-rendered SVG file doesn't include ""id"" attribute values from Dot file","# svg:core

When rendering a Dot file to SVG using the `svg:core` [renderer](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/command.html#d:T), attributes such as [`id`](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:id), `class`, [`comment`](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:comment) and [`URL`](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:URL) are included in the SVG output.

For example, here's an input file called `test.dot`:

```bash
digraph FooBarTest {

    ""foo"" [id=""idNodeFoo"", class=""classNodeFoo"", comment=""commentNodeFoo"", URL=""http://google.com""];

    ""foo"" -> ""bar"" [id=""idEdgeFooBar"", class=""classEdgeFooBar"", comment=""commentEdgeFooBar"", URL=""http://apple.com""];

}
```

Command:

```
dot -v -Tsvg:svg:core -o test-core.svg test.dot
```

See the attached output file `test-core.svg`:

![test-core.svg](/uploads/b03a1d0afa5a3e9ab82de7173cefaec2/test-core.svg)

Here's an extract from it, showing the `id`, `class`, `comment` and `URL` values rendered:

```xml
<!-- commentNodeFoo -->
<g id=""idNodeFoo"" class=""node classNodeFoo"">
<title>foo</title>
<g id=""a_idNodeFoo""><a xlink:href=""http://google.com"" xlink:title=""foo"">
```

# svg:cairo

However, when using the `svg:cairo` [renderer](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/command.html#d:T), none of those attribute values are included in the SVG output.

Command:

```
dot -v -Tsvg:cairo:cairo -o test-cairo.svg test.dot
```

See the attached output file `test-cairo.svg`:

![test-cairo.svg](/uploads/211e7908a4717fc17b288b28279b44e7/test-cairo.svg)

This is the basic structure:

```xml
<svg>
    <defs>
        <g>
            <symbol id=""glyph0-1""> ... </symbol>
            ...
        </g>
    </defs>
    <g id=""surface1"">
        <rect />
        <path />
        <g>
            <use xlink:href=""#glyph0-1"" />
            ...
        </g>
        ...
    </g>
</svg>
```

All the nodes and edges are contained within `<g id=""surface1"">`, but the `id`, `class`, `comment` and `URL` values from the Dot file aren't included.

# Question

Is there a way to make the `svg:cairo` renderer include the `id` attribute values from the Dot file?

Specifically, can the `svg:cairo` renderer generate a [`<g id=""..."">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g) container element for each node and edge, using the `id` values from the Dot file? (in the same way as the `svg:core` renderer does)

For example:

```xml
<g id=""surface1"">
    <rect />
    <g id=""idNodeFoo""><!-- Is it possible for Cairo to generate this container element? -->
        <path />
        <g>
            <use xlink:href=""#glyph0-1"" />
            ...
        </g>
    </g>
    ...
</g>
```

The [documentation](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/output.html#ID) states:

> In the formats: `-Tcmap`, `-Tcmapx`, `-Tsvg`, `-Tvml`, the output generates `id=""node#""` properties for nodes, `id=""edge#""` properties for edges, and `id=""cluster#""` properties for clusters, with the `#` replaced by an internally assigned integer. **These strings can be provided instead by an externally provided `id=xxx` attribute on the object.**

1341,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1341","Stop nodes from centering","I have a praticular type of graph wich is sort of like a tree except all leaves point to a last common decendent. Is best understood by loking at an example (Is drawn horizontally):

![whole.svg](/uploads/2feb9fd8b02cd781e444bdb715aea974/whole.svg)

As you can see the result is rather messy, see it is suposed to rappresent a Work Breackdown Structure to better visualise the succession of task's during a project's timeline, the problem is that if tasks(nodes) at the same depth level are not aligned it gets very confusing.
Now, I've notices that eliminating the *START* and *END* nodes the graph is drawn correctly:

![body_only.svg](/uploads/34be9609a44cc277cfb13ea041caaa6a/body_only.svg)

So I've tryed isolating the nodes with a cluster but it tends to crowd, especialy as the number of nodes increses:

![clustered.svg](/uploads/fd7a255fc2bd0fa5112b3741ab954063/clustered.svg)

I've also tryed making a cluster for each depth level of the tree but it gives similarly disordered risults since nodes within a cluster ignore nodes outside when ordering.

I was thinking if there's any way to tell nodes not to position themeselves half way beatween their predecessors and successors (since that's what they seem to be doing)  hopefuly it would resolve everything, but I can't seem to find any attribute to specify this behavior.

Do you have any suggestions? Am I missing something? Could this be a new fiture to add?

PS: I'm working with pyGraphViz wich is a python library that offers bindings for graphviz, and I'm actually creating this graphs interactively by parsing a file containing the Work Breakdown Structure, wich means my app doesn't know how the graph is supossed to turn out except for a general idea, i.e. I don't have a specific graph from wich to hack out a solution.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2018-03-04 00:09:07.403-05","2021-05-08 00:06:45.269-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

In `make_vn_slot` in flat.c, `v` can be reallocted, but `av` is not updated, leaving it dangling:

```c

```

In `dot_cleanup_graph` in dotinit.c, the allocation is cleaned up, but `av` is used for this:

```c
    free(GD_rank(g)[i].av);
```

If `av` had been reallocated before this, then this will free the wrong address.  Also if `av` is used after the reallocate, it could potentially corrupt something else that had been assigned the address.

Using Windows 10, official Graphviz 2.38 build, pdf output.

Occured this issue when working on Eclipse GEF Dot bug #321775 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321775)

Hi there,
I have found some inconsistency between the manual at https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html and graphviz behaviour concerning alignment:

*  Initially, I expected an align/valign attribute on a `<table>` tag to set alignment of the cells contained in the `<table>`. However, upon rereading and considering graphviz behaviour, it appears, the align tags are to position said `<table>` itself, if it is contained in another table.

*  Following from that, the align/valign on a `<td>` tag seem to be used for both positioning the (text) cell content block as well as the cell in relation to its immediately surrounding table.

Please clarify, if either of those two expectations are wrong (and consider adding this to the manual).

Further:

*  When a height or width is set on `<table>`, the contained table cells are aligned as if no height/width was set and then the table is resized, effectively adding space only to the right and bottom, which does neither correspond with the valign set on `<td>`, nor the center default alignment.

```html
 digraph {
 	1 [label=<
 	<table border=""1"" height=""450"">
 	<tr>
 	<td align=""right"" balign=""left"" width=""200"" valign=""bottom"" color=""red"" height=""200"" fixedsize=""true"">Node<br />more  name</td>
 	</tr>
 	</table>>]
 
 }
```

The graphviz output:

![Actual_Output](/uploads/6e241869046e8f192cfdee7b7b6331c9/Actual_Output.png)

The initially expected output expecting center vertical alignment to apply as no valign is set on table (ignore missing ellipsoid shape):

![Expectation_naive](/uploads/24bfd43b5d751bdb0a1429533dcd41f8/Expectation_naive.png)

The expected output, if valign=""bottom"" was applied:

![Expected_Output](/uploads/8a1388a7f187ae93891b0f0ec81bc341/Expected_Output.png)


Very simple example for width:
```html
digraph {
	1 [label=<
	<table width=""200"">
	<tr>
	<td>Node</td>
	</tr>
	</table>>]
}
```

Expected output (again ignore missing ellipsoid shape):

Actual output:

In these graphs, as you can see in the examples a ""simple coloring scheme is used: longer edges are colored with colder colors, and short ones warmer"".

I am trying to reproduce this effect. However, I am puzzled how it is achieved because to calculate the appropriate color one needs to know the edge length first (or not?).

In Rgraphviz we bundle a (reduced) version of Graphviz 2.28.0 which is compiled as a static library, for linking into R.

I have gotten a report (from a skilled user) that this compilation fails when the user asks for `-O3` with GCC 8.  I have replicated this using GCC 8.2.0 in a Docker container. Specifically, when I load the `Rgraphviz.so` into the R library, it complains that `**_pow_finite` symbol is missing.

The user has tracked this symbol to the glib mathvec library (-lmvec), some details are at
  https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec
This library is used when `-ffast-math` is supplied, and this compiler flag is hardcoded into the Graphviz configure script.  The documentation suggests that when I use static linking, I need to use `-lmvec -lm`.  I am currently exploring this option. An alternative is to remove `-ffast-meth` flag.

So right now, this is just a report.  I am still investigating, but if anyone has a reaction to this, feel free to add in. This could be a general issue for Graphviz when GCC 8 gets rolled out more broadly.

If you need to replicate this and have access to docker, the compiler I use is available as gcc when I start docker using

The way I proceed is the following. From boost library, I create an adjancy_list:

```
struct VertexP { std::string tag; std::string shape;std::string style; };
struct EdgeP { std::string symbol; std::string color; };
struct GraphP { };

typedef adjacency_list<vecS, vecS, directedS, VertexP, EdgeP, GraphP> Graph;
```
I have a function which build my graph recursively from external data

Graph addnode_progeny(data, Graph );
Then, I have a function which generate the dot file of this graph.

```
void printGraphDot(Graph g, std::string file_path){
std::ofstream dot_file(file_path+"".dot"");
dynamic_properties dp;
dp.property(""node_id"", get(&VertexP::tag, g));
dp.property(""label"", get(&VertexP::tag, g));
dp.property(""shape"", get(&VertexP::shape, g));
dp.property(""style"", get(&VertexP::style, g));
dp.property(""label"", get(&EdgeP::symbol, g));
dp.property(""color"", get(&EdgeP::color, g));
dp.property(""rankdir"", boost::make_constant_property<Graph*>(std::string(""TB"")));
write_graphviz_dp(dot_file, g, dp);
}
```
Until this point, everything goes fine.

Now, I want to transform this dot file into png file. I do not want to pass by a system(""dot -Tpng input -o output"") command as, I dont want to oblige the user to have graphviz installed.

I have found a first idea in the following post: Generate image of GraphViz graph given dot text c++

I have adapted the code. I have added it to the previous function and it works when I need to generate ONE graph.

The new function is:

```
void printGraphDot(Graph g, std::string file_path){
std::ofstream dot_file(file_path+"".dot"");
dynamic_properties dp;
dp.property(""node_id"", get(&VertexP::tag, g));
dp.property(""label"", get(&VertexP::tag, g));
dp.property(""shape"", get(&VertexP::shape, g));
dp.property(""style"", get(&VertexP::style, g));
dp.property(""label"", get(&EdgeP::symbol, g));
dp.property(""color"", get(&EdgeP::color, g));
dp.property(""rankdir"", boost::make_constant_property<Graph*>(std::string(""TB"")));

write_graphviz_dp(dot_file, g, dp);
std::string o_arg = ""-o"" +file_path+"".png"";
std::string i_arg = file_path+"".dot"";
char* args[] = {const_cast<char*>(""dot""),
                const_cast<char*>(""-Tpng""),
                const_cast<char*>(i_arg.c_str()),
                const_cast<char*>(o_arg.c_str()) };

const int argc = sizeof(args)/sizeof(args[0]);
Agraph_t *h, *prev = NULL;
GVC_t *gvc;
gvc = gvContext();
gvParseArgs(gvc, argc, args);

while ((h = gvNextInputGraph(gvc)))
{
  if (prev)
  {
    gvFreeLayout(gvc, prev);
    agclose(prev);
  }
  gvLayoutJobs(gvc, h);
  gvRenderJobs(gvc, h);
  prev = h;
}
}
```
However, for multiple graph, if I call again this function, it does not work and I have a segmentation error. In fact, it is written that we can use only one GVC_t in an application, in the following documentation, page 25: http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/libguide.pdf.

So in the following case, it stops the program with segmentation fault:

```
printGraphDot( g1,  file_path1);
printGraphDot( g2,  file_path2);
```
Is there another way to generate png graph from dot file inside a C++ application without using the command?

1428,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1428","Want dot to directly support edges between clusters, and/or FDP to support rankdir=BT or gravity","I am trying to autogenerate a complex dependency diagram, with some nodes being represented as cluster subgraphs (containing sub-dependency diagrams) which are still nodes as well (they are not just containers of nodes, but are actual things that arrows can point to), such that the dependency arrows all point at least somewhat ""up"" the page, or at least don't point ""down"". A dependency diagram, at least in my case, should form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a single node as the ""root"" node which is directly or indirectly dependent on all other top-level nodes.

I have spent several days trying to accomplish this, and have achieved only partial success. This is frustrating, since this seems to me like a fairly basic use-case for GraphViz and hence the sort of thing that GraphViz should be able to easily support 'out of the box' without excessive tweaking, yet I have had to resort to strange workarounds:

1. If I use the 'dot' layout, in order to use subgraphs as nodes, I apparently have to create an invisible dummy node in each subgraph, and have edges that ""should"" go to any subgraph boundaries instead target the subgraph's dummy node, and use ""ltail"" and ""lhead"" attributes on those edges to reference the containing subgraph's name, so the arrows get clipped on the subgraph boundaries instead of extending all the way to the dummy nodes. 

    (Note: This is per StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2012036/graphviz-how-to-connect-subgraphs).

    I've gotten this working, but it has the unfortunate side effect that each invisible dummy node has a definite location within its parent cluster, and therefore the arrows drawn to it are drawn to target that location (before clipping) rather than drawn as if they were going to target the center of the cluster. This looks OK when the invisible dummy node ends up roughly in the center of the subgraph, but not so good when it ends up sitting near one corner.

2. Nonetheless, for ""dot"", I can use ""rankdir=BT"" to get arrows pointing generally up the page rather than down (although for some reason, nodes inside clusters often seem to ignore rankdir and are often right-to-left instead...?)

3. If I use the 'fdp' layout, clusters seem to be supported as first-class objects, so I don't need all of the ""dummy node"" and ""lhead/ltail"" workarounds (I can just create an edge from one cluster's name to another node or cluster name, for instance). Unfortunately, rankdir=BT seems to have no effect in such a case (but I don't see any documentation that says so), so my dependency arrows seem to end up pointing in various random directions, which would be fairly confusing for someone looking at the diagram.

So, in short, if I want to have some nodes be clusters in my diagram, and I want dependency ordering to be generally (exclusively?) bottom-to-top, I don't seem to have any good options.

I would like to have a way to accomplish this. I would also prefer that this way be fairly ""clean"" and not require nonintuitive workarounds. Some suggestions:

1. If the 'dot' algorithm is going to continue to require this workaround for drawing edges between clusters, then at least please provide some way to automate it. For instance, if a graph had ""compound=true', then inside each cluster subgraph, the tools could automatically create an invisible zero-size dummy node named after the cluster (with possibly some prefix to make it unlikely to overlap user's node names), and then if dot found an edge which was sourced or targeted at a cluster name, it could substitute the dummy node name and automatically add an ""lhead"" or ""ltail"" attribute referencing the cluster name. (Right now, the dot algorithm seems to treat cluster names as if they refer to nonexistent nodes).

2. It would be nice to have a way to force any such dummy nodes to be placed at the exact center of their clusters, rather than being placed wherever the placement algorithm sees fit to put them in the cluster.

3. It would be even nicer if dot just allowed use of clusters as sources or targets of edges, and drew edges to clusters as if they were to the center of the cluster, but clipped at its boundary as via lhead and ltail, without the need for any dummy nodes.

4. With regards to the 'fdp' algorithm, it would be nice if there was a way to directly specify rankdir=BT, or to at least achieve a similar effect as rankdir. If rankdir can't be implemented directly due to the nature of the algorithm (which to my limited understanding seems to involve some kind of physics model), then perhaps at least the algorithm could introduce some notion of ""gravity"" in an arbitrary direction (specified by rankdir or some other attribute) pulling on nodes away from some given node or set of nodes which were designated as ""fixed"" at the top, bottom, left, or right of the diagram. Thus in my case, a root node could be fixed at the bottom of the page, and the other nodes could ""float upwards"" as high as they could due to gravity pulling upwards, constrained by spring tension of edges.

In summary: Please provide a way to create a graph such as a ""dependency diagram with arrows pointing upwards"" which supports some nodes being clusters, and which is expressible directly in GraphViz with a minimum of workarounds required.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2018-09-23 00:09:14.906-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

I am trying to graph articles relations (each time an article refer to another article or external text) of the European GDPR (General Data Protection Reglement). I made that to show a visual comparaizon of  the complexity of this text with the other previous and current [french] laws regarding data protection.

In these graphs, each article is eventualy enclosed in nested subgraphs (Chapters, sections...)

Of course, I am not surprised that shuch topic (99 articles contained in 11 Chapters, and several hundred relations between them and other legal texts) would make a complex graph and that graphviz would not be able to compute it.

But what surprise me is that when tying to compute it (using `dot -Tsvg gdpr.gv -o gdpr.svg`), adding edges lines one after one, I pass from an almost instantly compute time to perhaps infinite (interrupted manualy after at more than 7 hours) time. 

Using the gdpr.gv file added to this post, where edges lines concerning articles 47 to 99 are commented out, you should se able to show a graph, uncommenting article 47 makes an ""infinite"" computing time (of course, I tried other combinations, line 47 is not guilty in itself, and commenting the subgraph sections permits to show the graph, but of course without the chapters grouping).

So, i[gdpr.gv](/uploads/700905b438f947d2b2446caff459746b/gdpr.gv)s there a way to compute this graph (whith other options, ) or it is impossible with curent graphviz versions or today's computing powers ?

I've developed a web application for interactive visual editing of graphs described in the DOT language that I'm looking for beta tester for. A few feature highlights:

* Insert node shapes by click or drag-and-drop.
* Draw edges between nodes.
* Select nodes and edges by click or by area drag and mark them in the text editor.
* Delete selected nodes and edges.
* Cut/Copy-and-paste a selected node.

Try it live at http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/.

See the [README](https://github.com/magjac/graphviz-visual-editor/blob/master/README.md) for more features.

Are there any plans to issue the next stable release?

The latest stable release is of Graphviz stable_release_2.40.1.  
It has a critical bug, it crashes on a significant class of DOT inputs, the simplest is:  
`digraph test { A; B; { rank=sink; A } }`  
The bug is fixed at head, I checked that it works on the latest snapshot, 2.41.20181004.0037.  

I'm using [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) that is an automated translation of Graphviz into JavaScript.  
Viz.js owner uses the latest stable release of Graphviz, that is reasonable.  
But as a result all the recent versions of Viz.js are affected by this critical bug and this makes them unusable for me.  
See the corresponding Viz.js [issue](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/issues/98).  
Now I started to face problems with the old version of Viz.js that I'm stuck on, so really need to upgrade.  
That's why a new stable release would be greatly appreciated.

I have tried setting the newrank attribute on the command line. I get the same result.

The addition of the last line - ""{rank=same Orders;Lineitem}"" is causing the error. The diagram is generated successfully without it.

Graphviz - v2.38 - 32-bit.

I have Visual Studio 2015, and windows 10.

I've tried to build the repository, as according to the instructions at http://www.graphviz.org/doc/winbuild.html for the latest version.  

I unpack a copy of the repository to C:\graphviz\
I've then run 'git init' and 'git submodule update --init' in C:\graphbiz\graphviz-master\ directory.

At this point, windows\dependencies\graphviz-build-utilities is a directory, that is empty.

I add 'C:\graphviz\graphviz-master\windows\dependencies\graphviz-build-utilities'
to my PATH environmental variable.

Now, opening the solution I get the following error:
Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs: Failed to backup file as C:\graphviz\graphviz-master\windows\Backup\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs
Stackoverflow suggests that I just create a new copy of it.

I go to project properties, Assembly Information, and create a new assembly called 'Graphviz'.  I leave everything else blank.

I then compile the application.  It can browse to files, but immediately crashes upon opening them.

Any hint as to what I need to do?

I'm guessing that git submodule update --init failed somehow, but I didn't get any warnings or errors as such, so I don't know if that's the issue.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2018-11-01 00:08:40.53-04","2018-11-02 00:09:35.965-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Clearly the error message is incorrect.  In the original graph, it was correctly drawing seemingly identical edges between other nodes, so the syntax itself seems correct.  My only guess is that it has something to do with nearby nodes.  Playing with spacing with ranksep & nodesep don't help.

So I tried something else:
```
digraph {

1. Every nodes has a type (e.g. company, product, employee,...)
2. Every type has a default image displayed on the node
3. Some nodes have individual image ( e.g. employee picture)
4. The data should be imported (e.g. from csv)
5. Nodes and edges should be edited on the UI as well

Could you please give me some suggestions (products / plugis, ...)  ?

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

Hidden edges should only be considered for determination of ranks only.

I am using Graphviz (neato) to produce Causal Loop Diagrams.  My goal is to emphasize feedback loops (cycles) where for instance: a causes b which causes c which in time causes a.  Occasionally for reasons I don't understand neato produces diagrams like the one attached where the circle shows arrows which do not all go in the same direction.  

In the bad example (attached) I would prefer for hiring_or_firing to be placed along the edge of the circle and the edge from workers to workers_gap be placed either inside or outside of the circle.  Another desireable outcome would be to change the edge from workers to workers_gap to be convex to form a more circular structure. To emphasize the loop between workers -> workers_gap -> hiring_or_firing

Here is the dot file content I used to generate the graph:

digraph G {
	edge [len=2.0]
	node [shape=plaintext]
	graph [overlap=false fontsize=12 splines=curved]
	desired_production->workers_gap;
	workers_gap->hiring_or_firing;
	hiring_or_firing->workers;
	workers->producing;
	producing->inventory;
	inventory->desired_production;
	workers->workers_gap;
 }

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master 89292b5945933b1501293c04894ed9cf886241be).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

In this complete example, there are two nodes with one edge pointing from one node's port to the other's, but when layout occurs it says the ports don't exist. They certainly do.

This seems to be down to the way record labels are handled in the common_node_init function?

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master 89292b5945933b1501293c04894ed9cf886241be).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

Instructions:
`unzip artifacts_124735086.zip`
`docker build --build-arg SANITIZER=address --tag=autofuzz-graphviz-124735086 autofuzz_124735086`
`docker run --entrypoint /fuzzing/repro.sh --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v $PWD/autofuzz_124735086/poc-faa2681a27e64f2b46e137ed1ffda991a36aeb1491ee83626774fac66cd77c49_min:/tmp/poc autofuzz-graphviz-124735086 """" /tmp/poc`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

I tried to rebuild graphviz with prepared SWIG 4 and I found that Perl and PHP extension are not built. It is caused, because check in configure.ac failed. The reason is that the list of options in help changed:
* '-perl' was replaced by '-perl5', both are valid, but only the '-perl5' is listed in help
* '-php5' was removed, because PHP 5 is not supported now
* if language option is not valid, the error message will be 'No target language specified'

take the following **gv** program and compile using this command:

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master fb96c550b1db58ae5ae7610026dae1e7ac8afe87).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

The attributed parse tree visualization generation is implemented using the ***cgraph*** library as a strict directed graph where all nodes, save for the tree's root node, have exactly one **in-edge**. I use ***agwrite()*** to write the DOT-language representation of the attributed parse tree visualization into a file for off-line layout and rendering.

For this application, the left-to-right ordering of **out-edges** from an **interior node** is important. The Cgraph library tutorial ([cgraph.pdf](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/pdf/cgraph.pdf)) contains the following statements that led me to believe this would be trivial:
* At the end of **Section 6, Traversals**: ""Traversals are guaranteed to visit the nodes of a graph, or edges of a node, in their order of creation in the root graph ...""
* At the start of **Section 16, Open Issues**: ""**Node and Edge Ordering**. The intent in Cgraph’s design was to eventually support user-defined node and edge set ordering, overriding the default (which is object creation timestamp order).""

In my initial implementation, the ***agwrite()*** function did not traverse the **out-edges** of my application's parse trees in edge-creation order in some cases, so the visualization did not always correspond to the left-to-right parse of the input sentence.

Inspecting the ***cgraph*** implementation, I found that the code for the edge compare function ***agedgeseqcmpf()*** in ***edge.c***, used when adding a new **out-edge**, orders the edges by creation timestamp of the **out-edge head node** and not the **out-edge** itself (if both **out-edges** have the same **head node**, the **out-edges** are ordered by edge-creation order).

I was able to work-around this in my application by replacing the built-in edge compare function. Attached [cgraph_edge_order.c](/uploads/7616f94ce2e48bb77d900e251fb029eb/cgraph_edge_order.c) is a trivial sample application that demonstrates the before and after result.

While it isn't clear to me why ***agedgeseqcmpf()*** is written as it is, it has been that way since ***edge.c*** was first added to the [repository](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/), so it must have some design rationale.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2019-04-02 00:09:20.934-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

```c
...
ifdef HAVE_SYS_MMAN_H
    us->data = mmap(0, statbuf.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
#else
    us->data = malloc(statbuf.st_size);

```

If `mmap` is available (when `HAVE_SYS_MMAN_H` is defined) it is used instead of `malloc`. However the surrounding code seems to expect `us->data` to end up as `NULL` if the allocation failed. `mmap` doesn't return `NULL`, but `MAP_FAILED` on allocation failure. The result is that this code will not notice an `mmap` failure and attempt to use the invalid pointer `-1`.

The same code also appears in plugin/core/gvloadimage_lasi.c (copy paste?).

I think the cleanest fix is to check `us->data` against `MAP_FAILED` in the `HAVE_SYS_MMAN_H` case and set it to `NULL` if true.

Here's the code I'm using to create the graph:
```c

  root_data = atoi(agnameof(root->cnode));
  node_data = atoi(agnameof(node->cnode));

		  root->left = node;
		  edge = agedge (g, root->cnode, node->cnode, 0, TRUE);

It appears that the option homebrew option --with-app has been erased.  i.e. brew install graphviz --with-app now does not work, as per [this homebrew issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/31510)

This makes it very difficult for the majority of MacOS users to access the GraphViz.app (relatively few people have MacPorts comparatively, nor I could not find a location to download an installer.)  

I guess some of the possible resolutions would be:

1) include GraphViz.app in the default homebrew install;

2) create an additional graphviz-app homebrew either package or cask, which contains GraphViz.App;

3) allow people to download a build of the application from somewhere.

The only way it seems one can now access it is to install macports, or perhaps build it from source.

At runtime, the user can choose different colors from a drop-down list for different graph elements. For example, articulation nodes can be represented differently than normal nodes, or bridge edges can be shown in a special color.

Since I am developing the GUI application with Qt, I have a list containing the built-in global color names which Qt supports, such as ""darkRed"". Additionally, the user can choose a custom color from the entire RGB gamut which returns a coded RGB name like ""#ffe0e0"" for light red, for example. When I use the coded RGB value directly in the DOT file, it works as expected (it has to be quoted, though).

But GraphViz also supports some named colors. Unfortunately, there is no obvious 1-to-1 correlation except for the primary colors (red, green, blue) and complements. I saw that there is a source file called ""color_names"" in graphviz/lib/common with several hundred named colors, some of which appear to be quite exotic (""chocolate"" or ""midnightblue"", for example). The color ""darkred"" appears there, but when I use this (e.g.) ""fillcolor=darkred"", the above warning appears.

How can I determine at runtime which named colors are supported by the user's GraphViz installation? (I realize there is also the ""colorscheme"" parameter, but the user might not have a particular colorscheme installed).

It's virtually unreadable. I want to rearrange the nodes but this is where I'm having difficulties.

When I move a node, it works fine and all of the edges from other nodes are snapped to it properly, but if I ""put the node down"" in a particular place on the ""canvas"", it doesn't actually pick up and move so it seems to be stuck in the new location forever and cannot be moved a second time. This makes rearranging my graph next to impossible.

Steps to reproduce:
* Open a dot file using dotty with several nodes and interconnected edges.
* Left-click and hold on a node, move it, let go of left-button. Node is now located where dropped.
* Left-click and hold on the same node and attempt to move it. What is drawn instead is an oval where the cursor is when the button is released.
* Node moved in step 2 is permanently stuck in place.

1566,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1566","Styles for GraphViz","There is a lot of repetition in styling nodes and edges in dot (and probably the other GraphViz languages(?) too). One could group nodes and edges and defined a style for them all, however, that only works when one is not trying to make a complex graph and has only a few nodes. I found the request from @GadgetSteve to create classes for nodes and edges, and I thought that I would bring it up again since nothing has come from it in three years. So here is his suggestion again, and I like it.
```
digraph new_feature_request {
  node [ shape = circle, color = black ];
  node.foo [ shape = rectangle, color = red ];
  node.bar [ shape = diamond, color = green ];
  node.foo.bar [ shape = ellipse ];

  edge [ style = solid, arrowsize = 1 ];
  edge.foo [ style = dashed ];
  edge.bar [ style = dotted ];
  edge.baz [ arrowsize = 2 ];

  C -> R [ label = ""solid big black arrow"", class = baz ];
  R -> D [ label = ""dotted big black arrow"", class = ""baz foo"" ];
  D -> E [ label = ""bold big black arrow"", class = ""foo baz"", style = bold ];

  graph.foo [ /* etc. */ ];
}
```

However, that is not the end of problems with styling. I was recently experimenting with HTML tables. That is when I found that the `style` attribute in the table was still the GraphViz `style` attribute. That makes it very hard to make tables and other HTML labels a pain to style. Currently, the HTML labels use very deprecated HTML attributes. They are so old that I have forgotten how to use them after learning the CSS to achieve the same effects. So I propose that once an HTML label is invoked, the `style` attribute be given to CSS styles.

```
graph foo {
  bar [
    shape=""plaintext"",
    label=< /* this triggers style going over to css */
      <table style=""border-collapse: collapse; border: none;"">
        <tr>
          <td style=""background-color:#ffcccc;"" post=""LightRed"">Light red</td>
          <td style=""font-style:italic;"" port=""Italic"">Italic text</td>
          <td style=""border: 4px solid #00ff00;"" port=""SolidBlack"">Solid black border</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    > /* the style attribute goes back to GraphViz styles. */
  ];
}
```

GraphViz could go one step further and have CSS styles predefined too. Using the above suggestion by Steve Barnes and my example table, here is how it could look.

```
digraph new_feature_request {
  styles [
    gvss = {
      node         [ shape = circle,    color = black ];
      node.foo     [ shape = rectangle, color = red ];
      node.bar     [ shape = diamond,   color = green ];
      node.foo.bar [ shape = ellipse ];

```

And if one is making several graphs using the same styles, `styles` could have an attribute of `file`.

```
  styles [ file=""style_file.gvss"" ] /* GraphViz style sheet */
```

An external GraphViz style sheet would certainly help me right now with the 24 graphs I am making using the same styles over and over.

1567,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1567","Suggestion: support a ""fontweight"" attribute","It seems to be impossible to specify font weights and styles in the DOT language except by mangling the **fontname** attribute value. If the renderer can grok the fontname, e.g. fontname=""Times-Bold"", it will export **font-family=""Times,serif"" font-weight=600""** in SVG files, for example, and it will be correctly rendered. But there is no way to know for which fonts this will actually work. And if you write the font family name out entirely, e.g. fontname=""Times New Roman-Bold"", it doesn't work (and the font family is not correctly rendered, either). One could say that this is somewhat less than orthogonal.

Why can't we simply write fontname=""Times New Roman"" (or any other name with spaces, of which there are quite a few) and fontweight=""bold"" (or alternatively fontweight=700)?

The children orders are `b -> c -> d` as I expect.
```
digraph G {
  a -> b;
  a -> c;
  a -> d;
}
```

  a -> c;
  a -> d;
}
```

1614,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1614","Dot is not producing deterministic output for SVG files","When using dot to produce SVG files, it turns out that the output is not deterministic. Running dot multiple time with the same input produces different svg output files. The difference is of no importance to how the SVG file is rendered, but it does thwart our efforts to produce reproducible builds in our setup (building OpenJDK, where SVG files generated by dot is part of the Javadoc API documentation). For now we can add an exception for SVG files to be reproducible, but there seems to be no good reason for the output to be randomly changed, so I believe a fix in GraphViz should be in place.

This is an example snippet of a file that has changed:

Note how the id ""edge28"" and ""edge29"" has swapped place.

We've been chasing non-reproducibility in OpenJDK for a while, so I recognize this kind of non-deterministic behavior. This kind of effects typically comes from using values from a hash map, where the internal order of the hash map is used directly in the output. A common solution is to normalize or sort the values before using them.

I want to display a network consisting of data centers and carrier links in between. Unfortunately, instead of laying out the nodes within the cluster subgraphs and afterwards layouting the subgraphs and the inter-subgraph links, neato layouts the whole graph first and then afterwards draws the areas around the sugraphs.

This results in overlapping subgraphs.

How can I make the subgraphs not overlap.

Also, it would be nice if I could roughly position the subgraphs.

Any help or pointer is appreciated.

It does happen for all output types essentially (like `-Tdot`, `-Tplain` and `-Tpng`).

This is using Debian/GNU Linux testing and unstable, on amd64, graphviz package version 2.42.2-3 (but `dot -v` says to me `graphviz version 2.43.0 (0)`).


Similar more complex example with a bit different error message related to `dely >= 0` assertion failure.

dot usually produces perfect or close to perfect results, but sometimes it does really bizarre things that are known to be an issue, and even mentioned in the man page.

This happens to polylines too (I assume polylines are just quantized splines internally).

This happens even for reasonably small non-planar DAGs and sometimes for fully upward planar graphs too.

I think fixing this would significantly improve the quality of graphviz graphs. The same happens for much simpler graph (i.e. without ports or custom styles).

My current workaround is to do `dot -Tplain-ext` layout with `polylines` and do postprocessing on all the edges manually to find unnecessary intersection of common source edges, and collapse into multi edges sometimes. It adds a lot of the extra complexity to my program tho of course.

I feel that maybe it could be fixed reasonably easy with some constrains on tangents of splines as they exit/enter the node? But I do not want necessarily constrain them to be to be constant 90 degree. Fanning them out gently would be preferable, just like it is doing it now, just in well ... correct order.

The best I could achieve is this, with 27 crossings:

[output-white-27.dot](/uploads/e1126732a84a88edd76b6b4472a99927/output-white-27.dot)

If you look closely at the nodes at the right, most specifically a big node with 6 inputs, a ""Satellite"", and smaller one with 3 inputs, a ""Rocket part"" , you would probably say, to just flip two obviously suboptimal inputs to it: Flip (reorder ports) radar and solar_panel inputs to Satellite, and flip rocket_fuel and rocket_control_unit inputs to rocket_part and you will instantly go down to 25 crossings.

Well, unfortunately it doesn't work. It actually produces completely different layout, and with way more crossings, 49 actually, not less!

So, I am not sure what to do. I understand `dot` doesn't provide strong guarantees on edge crossings, but it was disappointing dot can't do it better, when it seems if could do it.

My workaround if I don't find another way is probably to do a 2 pass layout, with first finding a layout (and order of ports) that minimizes numbers of crossings, then read the full layout back, fix the position of nodes, change order of ports, and the do layout again, but with positions of nodes constrained fully, so only edges are routed and splines / polylines drawn. Not a fun thing to do tho.

PS. It is possible possible to improve number of crossings even below 25 in the initial graph, by introducing more ranks. Anytime an edge crosses over all inputs of a node, and there is less outputs than inputs (which is almost always the case for the graphs I work with here), it is sufficient to simply route edge behind the node, instead in front of a node to reduce number of edge crossings. The graph will be wider (less square), but it does in fact improve legibility a bit in some cases. With various tricks I can do 17 edge crossings, if I do layout manually, and still keep all edges direction left to right, at the expanse of some minor detours or widening the layout. And down to 16 with edge concentrators. (Using edge concentrators in the initial layout only removes one intersection, from 27 down to 26, by merging `electric_circuit -> {speed_module, processing_unit}` edges ).

PS2. I do not want to manually lay out all these graphs because I have about 800 of these graphs.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2019-11-11 00:08:26.649-05",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

Could you please take a look at the related files and confirm if it's a misuse of parameters or a bug of `dot` itself?

Regards,

Chun Tian

I am contacting you regarding Graphviz libraries. First of all, I would like to thank the whole team for this very nice tool.

I would like to report a bug that I observed when using graphviz as a library within c++ code and qt creator on windows.

Based on the example from the documentation, I used the following function to convert a dot file in png file:

```
bool saveImageGV(){       

    GVC_t *gvc= gvContext();

    gvAddLibrary(gvc, &gvplugin_dot_layout_LTX_library);

    gvAddLibrary(gvc, &gvplugin_core_LTX_library);

    gvAddLibrary(gvc, &gvplugin_gd_LTX_library);

    FILE *fp = fopen((pathTmp + "".dot"").c_str(), ""r"");

    Agraph_t *g = agread(fp,0);

    gvLayout(gvc, g, ""dot"");

    FILE *fp2 = fopen((pathTmp  + "".png"").c_str(), ""w"");

    gvRender(gvc, g, ""png"", fp2);

    gvFreeLayout(gvc, g);

    agclose(g); fclose(fp); fclose(fp2);

    return (gvFreeContext(gvc));

}
```

It appears that on linux, this function works very well with graphviz 2.30 and I succeed to convert my dot file into a png file.

However, when I use the windows libraries, I got a segmentation fault with the same function.

My investigations let me think the problems could come from the .dll libraries as, on linux, it worked with the 2.30 version but not with the 2.38 version of the libraries. With windows, 2.30 and 2.38 lead to the same error of segmentation fault.

Is it a well known bug and it exists another way to convert a dot file into png file on windows? I link the libraries from the ""Graphviz2.38\lib\release\lib"" folder and take the dlls from ""Graphviz2.38\lib\release\dll"" folder.

I thank you in advance for your response and if you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

There is a corner case when Node1 produces Edge1 and Edge2, but Node2 consumes Edge2 and Edge1, in that order. A case like this would be impossible to represent with ""Node1 -> Node2"" syntax.

`

then one can read the file into a Agraph_t G. 

`
    G = agread(f, 0);

    for ( n = agfstnode(G); n != NULL; n = agnxtnode(G, n) ) {

Here we iterate over all nodes and then iterate over all edges of each node and we will only find ONE edge a--b, but not b--a (although I would have expected that). So ""b"" can be reached from ""a"", but ""a"" cannot be reached from ""b"". 

I would have expected, that edges of an undirected graph should be symmetric in that sense, that every edge would create TWO entries in the internal adjacency list. But this seems not to be the case.

How could this symmetry be achieved? One could enter all reversed edges in the dot file, but that seems strange (especially for a symmetric graph) and would create redundant edge lines.

The labels are poorly positioned, nearly overlapping.

I would define *improve* by:

1. edge labels do not overlap with each other
1. edge labels do not overlap edges 
1. *optionally / ideally* edge labels are drawn along the edge. 

3 may not be possible, but 1 and 2 should be sufficient.

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master e55af3cce23ddcdeefb42b75d115ee23e86e456b).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

Instructions:
* `unzip artifacts_122575825.zip`
* `docker build --build-arg SANITIZER=address --tag=autofuzz-graphviz-122575825 autofuzz_122575825`
* `docker run --entrypoint /fuzzing/repro.sh --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v $PWD/autofuzz_122575825/8394a7f7-741a-4863-b1a4-deb2c4ab1620:/tmp/poc autofuzz-graphviz-122575825 """" /tmp/poc`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master e55af3cce23ddcdeefb42b75d115ee23e86e456b).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master e55af3cce23ddcdeefb42b75d115ee23e86e456b).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:

1683,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1683","Nested/Indirect Elements Result in Direct Linkages?","While using debug statements in Graphviz digraph syntax to generate a runtime call tree, I came across what I believe to be a display bug in GV.

If a graph contains several nested elements, the outer elements unexpectedly get direct links to the inner elements when the graph is rendered.

For example, I would expect this nested graph to produce the same results as the non-nested version (below), since none of the nested calls are direct.

Nested graph:

```
digraph g {
    ""eat.py::dog_eat"" -> {
        ""eat.py::pick_food"" -> {
            ""eat.py::load_beef"" -> {
                ""database.py::open_db""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Flat graph:

```
digraph g {
    ""eat.py::dog_eat"" -> ""eat.py::pick_food"" -> ""eat.py::load_beef"" -> ""database.py::open_db""
}
```

The unexpected resulting graph is attached.  In that graph, `dog_eat` appears to directly call `open_db` even though it does not.  **Is there any way to force a nested graph to hide indirect callers in the output?**  Unfortunately, the nested syntax is the only way I can differentiate between a function that calls multiple child functions and a child function that calls multiple grandchildren.

Thanks for your time.

So, I just decided to let them in nodes' tooltip. ( mouseover, then text appears )
However, I cannot find the way to copy that tooltip to clipboard.

To align daily new reported cases vertically, I use `rank`. For example, cases 218 to 221, shown at the top-right corner of the graph, are placed at the same X position with ""4/4"" (April the 4th).

But the number of cases is increasing everyday unfortunately, and the graph is growing vertically everyday accordingly.

I would like to keep graph height as small as possible and I would like to know how to relocate new cases at the bottom. Could anyone please tell me how to do it?

make[4]: *** [libgv_python3_la-gv_python3.lo] Error 1
```

it looks like python3 headers are missing, but actually Python3 is already installed (using brew install python3) and headers are located right where the Makefile has it configured:

```
/usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers
```

I've also verified that Python3.h file is there (just in case). Changing the python include options in Makefile has not been successfull:

```
PYTHON3_INCLUDES = /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers

PYTHON_INCLUDES = /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers
```

It simply seems to be overlooking such settings …

1705,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1705","Label edges with splines=ortho don't show if rank=same","Hello,

I am using Graphviz 2.43 on Linux (debian package). When using `dot` (tested with PNG output), some edge labels are not drawn at all when using `splines=ortho` and `rank=same` under some particular conditions.

What happened
=============

The following graph shows edge labels correctly, despite the warning that edge labels don't work with `splines=ortho` (`Warning: Orthogonal edges do not currently handle edge labels. Try using xlabels.`):
```
digraph G {
    splines = ortho;

    a -> b [label=""a to b""]
    b -> c [label=""b to c""]
}
```

This graph, however, does not show any edge label:
```
digraph G {
    splines = ortho;
    {rank=same; a; b; c;}

    a -> b [label=""a to b""]
    b -> c [label=""b to c""]
}
```
Notice the presence of `rank=same`.

However, if at least one of the edges uses `xlabel` instead of `label`, both edges are labelled in `dot` output:
```
digraph G {
    splines = ortho;
    {rank=same; a; b; c;}

    a -> b [xlabel=""a to b""]
    b -> c [label=""b to c""]
}
```
Notice that only one of the edges uses `xlabel` while the other uses `label`, yet both are properly labelled in `dot`'s output.

What I expected

I expected all graphs above to have their edges labelled.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-04-27 00:03:30.074-04","2020-06-04 00:07:53.7-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

1708,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1708","libgvc not safe to build with NDEBUG defined","There is code in lib/gvc like the following in gvbuffstderr.c:

```c
assert ((b = malloc(sizeof(struct buff_s))));
assert ((b->template = strdup(""/tmp/stderr_buffer_XXXXXX"")));
```

With `NDEBUG` defined, assertions become no-ops and these statements are omitted leading to `b` being uninitialized following this point. The fix would be something like:

```diff
+if (!(b = malloc(sizeof(struct buff_s))))
+  return NULL;
+if (!(b->template = strdup(""/tmp/stderr_buffer_XXXXXX""))) {
+  free(b);
+  return NULL;
+}
-assert ((b = malloc(sizeof(struct buff_s))));
-assert ((b->template = strdup(""/tmp/stderr_buffer_XXXXXX"")));
```

However this assumes callers are actually anticipating failure as a possibility, which is unlikely. In this specific case it looks like the containing function, `buffstderr`, is unused so maybe the simplest solution is to just delete it.

I ran the code in GVEdit version 1.02, Graphviz version: 2.38.0

## Expected result
1. A graph that shows a crow arrowtype instead of no arrowtype next to imageID in trelRelated

## Actual result:

1. The following appears in the output console
```
Warning: Arrow type ""8"" unknown - ignoring
Warning: Arrow type ""8"" unknown - ignoring
```
2. A graph that shows no arrowType in one instance instead of a crow arrowType:
![notgood](/uploads/2e8ffbc4cd9afe2877221281394fb648/notgood.png)

## Other
1. More testing shows that removing the ranks or changing the font and font size changes the output to be correct.  For example, change
```
edge  [fontname=""Tahoma"", fontsize = ""8"", arrowhead=""crow"", minlen=2];
```
to
```
edge  [arrowhead=""crow"", minlen=2];
```
![better](/uploads/2c0590654eea3f39363f49ec9d3ef605/better.png)

It seems to me that whether or not a font and size is specified for an edge, Graphviz should produce the same graph with respect to the arrowType.

2. Ideally, I would run the code with the latest version of Graphviz, but I am not clever enough to compile GVEdit.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-05-14 00:04:50.084-04","2022-11-06 00:02:30.489-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/21/windows-shared-runner-beta/

AppVeyor is pretty slow, limiting free plans to one parallel job running at once - in practice this means it can take over half an hour for builds and tests to run on Windows.

But GitLab CI is free for Open Source projects like Graphviz, so we could run the jobs in parallel.

Today, the windows jobs don't run at pull-request time, only after merging (probably because they're so slow). It would be good to make them fast so they can run at pull-request time.

> It's a pity that we currently don't run the Windows builds in the test stage before deploy because then it doesn't get run for merge requests. @ellson Can we can change this?

While it's true that this is a version that *can* be downloaded and installed, the reader may be led to believe that it's latest version which it is not. It's actually [more than 6 years old](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/ChangeLog).

If possible, this should be replaced with a permalink to the latest ""official"" release. This is currently 2.44 and can be found through [this link](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ellson/graphviz-pl238/builds/32032002). This is however not a permalink.

If it's not possible to generate such a permalink, we should just remove the link and replace it with a description on how to find the latest official Windows releases or copy the releases to a place to which we *can* create such a permalink.

```c
/* note that MEMCPY advances the associated pointers */
#define MEMCPY(to,fr,n) \
	switch(n) \
	{ default : memcpy((void*)to,(void*)fr,n); to += n; fr += n; break; \
	  case  7 : *to++ = *fr++; \
	  case  6 : *to++ = *fr++; \

	  case  3 : *to++ = *fr++; \
	  case  2 : *to++ = *fr++; \
	  case  1 : *to++ = *fr++; \
	}
```

Newer GCC has `-Wimplicit-fallthrough` enabled by default which causes all expansions of this macro to spray quite a lot of warning text. It seemed like a nice simple change to add `/* fallthrough */` comments to suppress this. However, modern compilers and libcs are capable of doing the micro-optimization in this macro by themselves, so why not simplify the whole macro I thought:

```diff

     extern Sfextern_t _Sfextern;
     extern Sftab_t _Sftable;
```

However while doing this I noticed what I think is a subtle bug. This macro implicitly assumes its inputs are char pointers. Looking at the first call site I came across, this is not true, lib/gvmap/make_map.c:1895-1899:

```c
      int *grouping2;
      nzok0 = nzok = *nrandom - 1;/* points that are within tolerance of real or artificial points */
      grouping2 = MALLOC(sizeof(int)*(n + *nrandom));
      MEMCPY(grouping2, grouping, sizeof(int)*n);
      grouping = grouping2;
```

The inputs are int pointers here. So, e.g. on x86-64, the `MEMCPY` invocation steps the two pointers forwards by 4 times the numbers of bytes copied. This seems clearly incorrect.

Like, in

    x -> a
    y -> a
    z -> a

the text and therefore also the node ""a"" would be 3 times larger than any x, y or z node. When you have like 10000 of incoming connections into a, then every other one may be only a little, nearly invisible bubble. 

As I've said, this would be of great help and I believe this is technically easy to realize for somebody who knows about the GraphViz code.

1738,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1738","[feature request]I would like to have a replace function to replace a text-placeholder in html node","Backgound:
I'm not a developer, I'm an analyst
I'm using a plantuml to generate my diagrams. One of the diagrams not supported by plantuml is the dfd (dataflow diagram)
But since plantuml uses graphiz and support native graphiz notation, I created a template for me to generate dfd diagrams.

One of the elements in a dfd diagram is a 'data store' drawn as a tekst (the name of the data) with a solid line drawn above it and a solid line drawn below it (think of some text in a rectangle with the left and right sides of the rectangle missing.

So.. graphiz doesn't support this shape out of the box so I created it using html node notation.
```
'create here all data stores
node[shape=plaintext, width=label, fixedsize=false,
label=<<table SIDES=""TB""
CELLSPACING=""15"" 
CELLPADDING=""0"" 
BORDER=""2""
CELLBORDER=""0"" 
><tr><td>
my text comes here
</td></tr></table>>
]
datastore1
datastore2
```

and this works but I now have two times the same shape, which is ok, but also the same text in my shape which isn't ok.
I know I can overwrite my node label data, but that would mean that for every element I have on my diagram of this type, I need to copy the whole html and fiddle with the html code every time. This is not very practical and certainly not clear.


what I would like is some feature that 
option1:
uses the html as 'background' image and allows me to add text independent of the html (like we have on other shapes already)
like this:
```
node[shape=plaintext, width=50, height=20, fixedsize=true,
**HTML**=<<table SIDES=""TB""
CELLSPACING=""15"" 
CELLPADDING=""0"" 
BORDER=""2""
CELLBORDER=""0"" 
><tr><td>
 
</td></tr></table>>
]
datastore1 **[label=""my 1st text""]**
datastore2 **[label=""my 2nd text""]**
```


or option2:
allows me to put some special html tag (a text-placeholder) in my html that can afterwards be replaced by the real text
like this:
```
'create here all data stores
node[shape=plaintext, width=label, fixedsize=false,
label=<<table SIDES=""TB""
CELLSPACING=""15"" 
CELLPADDING=""0"" 
BORDER=""2""
CELLBORDER=""0"" 
><tr><td>
**<\textplaceholder>**
</td></tr></table>>
]
datastore1 **[textplaceholder=""my 1st text""]**
datastore2 **[textplaceholder=""my 2nd text""]**
```

where option2 has my preference as it is more flexible

""So what?"" you say, ""it runs quickly and then exits which automatically cleans up."" However, this program is compiled and run during the Graphviz build process. A side effect of this is that whatever is in your `CFLAGS` is applied when compiling it. This includes things like when you've enabled Address Sanitizer and told it to fail on leak detection. This then causes a build failure. To compound the situation, this is dependent on what level of compiler optimization (`-O0`, `-O1`, ...) you're using, which affects how the compiler can manipulate these heap allocations.

Rather than trying to track heap allocations and free everything before exiting, I think we should just rewrite this in a scripting language where we don't need to deal with manual memory management.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-06-14 00:07:28.034-04","2020-06-15 00:09:35.848-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Of the three call sites of `setjmp`, two return immediately. The remaining one in `RBTreeCreate` looks like this (lib/rbtree/red_black_tree.c:38-47):

```c
38   rb_red_blk_tree* newTree = NULL;
39   rb_red_blk_node* temp;
40
41   if (setjmp(rb_jbuf)) {
42     if (newTree) {

```

As far back as C89, the standard has the following wording:

> All accessible objects have values as of the time `longjmp` was called, except that the values of objects of automatic storage duration that are local to the function containing the invocation of the corresponding `setjmp` macro that do not have volatile-qualified type and have been changed between the `setjmp` invocation and `longjmp` call are indeterminate.

I have noticed recent versions of GCC (~9 onwards) taking advantage of this clause. I would not be surprised if an optimizing compilation removes the calls to `free` in this block, or even removes the `setjmp` entirely by reasoning backwards that no matching `longjmp` can occur because it would lead to indeterminate reads. Older GCC should warn about this with `-Wclobbered` and newer GCC with `-Wmaybe-unitialized`. I think we should proactively refactor this before someone files a cryptic issue stemming from a corrupted `longjmp`.

We could address this by marking `newTree` `volatile`. However the use of this mechanism is limited enough that I think we should just refactor rbtree to use conventional return codes instead of exception-style.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-06-16 00:00:22.6-04","2020-08-01 00:00:28.888-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Sometimes there are visual issues.

In the attached screenshot there are two problems:
1. Why some edges cross boxes? (sometimes GraphViz makes an effort to draw lines around boxes and sometimes it doesn't)
2. Some edges are rendered too close and this makes them confusing.

CORRECTION: The first issue is not crossing. The box has 2 ins and 2 outs. But GraphViz draws the second line as if it is crossing. It should attempt to place them more like this:

As part of our fuzzing efforts at Google, we have identified an issue affecting
graphviz (tested with revision * master dbb3e130ef59eb9677c25f974c4d249f6382464a).

To reproduce, we are attaching a Dockerfile which compiles the project with
LLVM, taking advantage of the sanitizers that it offers. More information about
how to use the attached Dockerfile can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

Instructions:
* `unzip artifacts_159147107.zip`
* `docker build --build-arg SANITIZER=address --tag=autofuzz-graphviz-159147107 autofuzz_159147107`

Alternatively, and depending on the bug, you could use gcc, valgrind or other
instrumentation tools to aid in the investigation. The sanitizer error that we
encountered is here:

1. Download the `msbuild` `Debug`and `Release` builds from e.g. [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ellson/graphviz-pl238/builds/33666719).
2. unzip to different directories

Same output for both.

1748,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1748","The Windows CMake installer does not remove previously installed Graphviz version","## Steps to reproduce

1. Download `Graphviz-install.exe` from e.g. [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/kw9k9h7lt74he1j4/artifacts/build%2FGraphviz-install.exe)
2. Run it
3. Repeat using another build version

## Expected Behaviour

IMHO, the default should be to install Graphviz without using the version and build date in the path or name, thus overwriting a previously installed version. Alternatively the version should be kept, but the build version (or patch version if it's an official release) dropped.

## Actual Behaviour

The new version is installed alongside previously installed versions if the defaults are accepted.

The reason being that the Windows CMake installer by default installs Graphviz under a path and name containing the version and build date.

```

I propose:
- installing man pages under the appropriate sections (`man1`, `man3`, `man7`)
- only installing man pages on non-Windows systems
- installing general application guides (existing PDFs) on all platforms
- generating PDFs from the existing man pages and installing those to Windows

I am making some kind of graph editor. When I read the dot file for the first time everything is good. But if I try to read the file again the graph messes up. Here is the code:

```cpp
#include <QFile>
#include <QDebug>

#include <cgraph.h>
#include <gvc.h>

void load(const QString& filename)
{
    Agraph_t *g;
    GVC_t *gvc(::gvContext());

    QFile file(filename);
    if (!file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text)) {
        qDebug() << ""File"" << filename << ""not found"";
        return;
    }
    g = ::agmemread(file.readAll().data());
    qDebug() << ""Loaded graph:"" << ::agnameof(g);

    if (::gvLayout(gvc, g, ""dot"") != 0) {
        qCritical() << ""Layout render error"" << ::agerrors() << QString::fromLocal8Bit(::aglasterr());
    }

    for (Agraph_t* sg = ::agfstsubg(g); sg != nullptr; sg = ::agnxtsubg(sg)) {
        qDebug() << ::agnameof(sg) << ""contains"" << ::agnnodes(sg) << ""nodes"";
    }

    ::gvFreeLayout(gvc, g);
    ::agclose(g);
    ::gvFreeContext(gvc);
}

int main()
{
    load(""subgraphs.dot""); //ok
    load(""subgraphs.dot""); //nodes mixed up
}
```

The file that I read:

```dot
digraph clusters {
    subgraph cluster_0 {
        a -> b -> c -> d -> e
    }

    subgraph cluster_1 {
        a -> f -> c
    }
    
    subgraph cluster_2 {
        rank = same
        p1
        p2
        p3->f
    }
    
    subgraph cluster_3 {
        rank = same
        S1->a
        S2->f
        S3->p1
    }
}
```

## Expected Behaviour

I expect to see the same graph as after first read but it is not so.

## Actual Behaviour

Output:
```
Loaded graph: clusters
cluster_0 contains 5 nodes
cluster_1 contains 1 nodes
cluster_2 contains 3 nodes
cluster_3 contains 3 nodes
Loaded graph: clusters
cluster_0 contains 5 nodes

So I dutifully checked out the source branch on my local Linux box and ran the CMake build instead of the Autotools build. But to my surprise, the test suite sprayed huge numbers of failures; not just failures related to the changes in that MR.

After some poking around, I realized the CI jobs are all running completely different test suites:
* the Linux jobs run `ci/test.sh`, which runs `python3 -m pytest --junitxml=report.xml tests rtest`
* the Windows Msbuild jobs run `tests/regression_tests/regression_tests.ps1`, which then runs a Python `unittest` test suite
* the Windows CMake jobs run:
  1. CMake-driven tests that call `python shapes.py` in tests/regression_tests/shapes; and
  2. `pytest -s rtest\test_examples.py`

To put it bluntly: this is a complete mess. We have little visibility into what is broken, coverage of the existing tests is difficult to determine, and it's very hard to even add a test and have confidence it will get run.

I don't mean this as an accusation of anyone (I know we're all doing our best), but we need to fix this situation.

## Steps to reproduce

The crash can be reproduced with the following input:

```
digraph code {
edge [weight=1073741824];
  ""1"" -> ""0"";
}
```

## OS Version

Lubuntu 19.10 x86_64

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.45.20200729.1351 (20200729.1351)

## Additional info

I'm not familiar with the codebase so I'll pass on whatever I could understand. The problem can be traced back to the weight parameter of an edge. This value is parsed as a `double` but is converted to `int` when it's used in cutvalue calculations in [x_val](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/0c58634ebd81e01614eb54fe82026327b6dcc9af/lib/common/ns.c#L937) and subsequently [x_cutval](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/0c58634ebd81e01614eb54fe82026327b6dcc9af/lib/common/ns.c#L914).

```
/* set cut value of f, assuming values of edges on one side were already set */
static void x_cutval(edge_t * f)
{
    node_t *v;
    edge_t *e;
    int i, sum, dir;

    /* set v to the node on the side of the edge already searched */
    if (ND_par(agtail(f)) == f) {
	v = agtail(f);
	dir = 1;
    } else {
	v = aghead(f);
	dir = -1;
    }

    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; (e = ND_out(v).list[i]); i++)
	sum += x_val(e, v, dir);                   // sum like there's no tomorrow
    for (i = 0; (e = ND_in(v).list[i]); i++)
	sum += x_val(e, v, dir);                   // sum like there's no tomorrow
    ED_cutvalue(f) = sum;                         // possibly overflown value
}
```

Because of the summation, this value can go arbitrarily high and overflow. This will cause [leave_edge](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/0c58634ebd81e01614eb54fe82026327b6dcc9af/lib/common/ns.c#L144) function to interpret the value as negative and somehow (I'm not sure how as I haven't grasped the intricate details) cause an empty list to be processed incorrectly later on.

```
static edge_t *leave_edge(void)
{
    edge_t *f, *rv = NULL;
    int j, cnt = 0;

    j = S_i;
    while (S_i < Tree_edge.size) {
	if (ED_cutvalue(f = Tree_edge.list[S_i]) < 0) {    // Overflown cutvalue will be skipped.
	    if (rv) {
		if (ED_cutvalue(rv) > ED_cutvalue(f))
		    rv = f;
	    } else
		rv = Tree_edge.list[S_i];
	    if (++cnt >= Search_size)
		return rv;
	}
	S_i++;
    }
    if (j > 0) {
	S_i = 0;
	while (S_i < j) {
	    if (ED_cutvalue(f = Tree_edge.list[S_i]) < 0) { // Overflown cutvalue will be skipped.
		if (rv) {
		    if (ED_cutvalue(rv) > ED_cutvalue(f))
			rv = f;
		} else
		    rv = Tree_edge.list[S_i];
		if (++cnt >= Search_size)
		    return rv;
	    }
	    S_i++;
	}
    }
    return rv;
}
```

This causes [enter_edge](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/0c58634ebd81e01614eb54fe82026327b6dcc9af/lib/common/ns.c#L227) to return `Enter == NULL` because of the check in `dfs_enter_outedge` and `dfs_enter_inedge`(both functions are almost identical):

```
static void dfs_enter_outedge(node_t * v)
{
    int i, slack;
    edge_t *e;

    for (i = 0; (e = ND_out(v).list[i]); i++) {    // If the list is empty,
	if (TREE_EDGE(e) == FALSE) {                // Enter will be untouched.
	    if (!SEQ(Low, ND_lim(aghead(e)), Lim)) {
		slack = SLACK(e);
		if ((slack < Slack) || (Enter == NULL)) {
		    Enter = e;
		    Slack = slack;
		}
	    }
	} else if (ND_lim(aghead(e)) < ND_lim(v))
	    dfs_enter_outedge(aghead(e));
    }
    for (i = 0; (e = ND_tree_in(v).list[i]) && (Slack > 0); i++)
	if (ND_lim(agtail(e)) < ND_lim(v))
	    dfs_enter_outedge(agtail(e));
}
```

Since `Enter` variable is not assigned, it will be returned as NULL from `enter_edge`:

```
static edge_t *enter_edge(edge_t * e)
{
    node_t *v;
    int outsearch;

    /* v is the down node */
    if (ND_lim(agtail(e)) < ND_lim(aghead(e))) {
	v = agtail(e);
	outsearch = FALSE;
    } else {
	v = aghead(e);
	outsearch = TRUE;
    }
    Enter = NULL;                // Enter is NULL
    Slack = INT_MAX;
    Low = ND_low(v);
    Lim = ND_lim(v);
    if (outsearch)
	dfs_enter_outedge(v);     // Enter is untouched
    else
	dfs_enter_inedge(v);      // Enter is untouched
    return Enter;                // returns NULL
}
```

Lastly, there is no NULL check in [rank2](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/0c58634ebd81e01614eb54fe82026327b6dcc9af/lib/common/ns.c#L865):

```
...
    while ((e = leave_edge())) {
	f = enter_edge(e);
	update(e, f);
	iter++;
	if (Verbose && (iter % 100 == 0)) {
	    if (iter % 1000 == 100)
		fputs(ns, stderr);
	    fprintf(stderr, ""%d "", iter);
	    if (iter % 1000 == 0)
		fputc('\n', stderr);
	}
	if (iter >= maxiter)
	    break;
    }
...
```

Therefore, the `f == NULL` value will go into `update` and cause the crash.

# Proposed fixes

- A simple NULL check before calling `update` will prevent the segmentation fault. 
- The `cutvalue`s should be `unsigned int`s (unless there are valid cases where they are negative). 
- There might also be logical issues that require fixes, but I'll leave that discussion to the developers.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-07-30 00:07:37.595-04","2020-08-09 00:02:44.539-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

I was trying to build Graphviz using the latest version of libc++ (the C++ Standard Library shipped with the Clang compiler, and used on Apple platforms), and I noticed the following error:

```
In file included from <graphviz>/blocks.cpp:22:
In file included from <graphviz>/blocks.h:32:
In file included from <toolchain>/usr/bin/include/c++/v1/set:427:

<toolchain>/usr/include/c++/v1/__bit_reference:172:38: error: no member named 'min' in namespace 'std::__1'
```

The issue is that we `#include <Block.h>` from <functional>, however Graphviz contains a block.h header (which is the same as Block.h on a case insensitive FS), and they collide. This triggers some circular dependency issue in libc++, which causes the build to fail. The root cause of the issue is that by including `<Block.h>` in libc++, we're potentially conflicting with a user-provided `<Block.h>` header. It would be better if `<Block.h>` were somehow namespaced, so that we know for sure we're not including a user provided header, however that's not the reality we live in.

I suggest fixing Graphviz in one of two ways:

1. Rename your `block.h` header to something else, or
2. Avoid adding `<graphviz>/lib/vpsc` to the include paths of the compiler. Instead, add `<graphviz>/lib` and then include `<vpsc/block.h>` from your code. This will effectively namespace the block.h header from your side, making sure that we don't find it when we include `<Block.h>` from libc++.

I acknowledge this is an annoying issue and I wish we had a better way of solving it from our side in libc++, however I can't think of a good solution from our side.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-07-31 00:08:40.797-04","2020-10-05 00:01:11.427-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

1790,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1790","Using PostScript shapefile on Windows produces incorrect output","## Steps to reproduce

* Clone the repository and `cd rtest`
* Run `dot -Tps -Nshapefile=graphs/dice.ps -o ps_user_shapes_dot.ps graphs\ps_user_shapes.gv`
* Try to view the `ps_user_shapes_dot.ps` file with a PostScript viewer (I failed to install one on Windows and transferred the file to an Ubuntu system and used `evince`)

## Expected Behaviour

The file should look similar to [rtest/linux.x86/ps_user_shapes_dot.ps](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/rtest/linux.x86/ps_user_shapes_dot.ps)

## Actual Behaviour

The file is corrupt and cannot be viewed.

## OS Version

Windows 10

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.44.1 (20200629.0800)

## Additional info
This problem is not the same as https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1787, but it may have the same root cause.

Most of the diff is the missing [rtest/graphz/dice.ps](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/rtest/graphs/dice.ps) file, but there is also some corruption. Concatenating the generated file with the shape file gives a much smaller diff:

1791,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1791","Regression: The CMake Windows development builds have (partly) the wrong version","## Steps to reproduce

Look in [this Windows CMake CI build log](https://gitlab.com/magjac/graphviz/-/jobs/678123414).

## Expected Behaviour

CPack should produce a file whose name contains the current VERSION, i.e. I expect to find a log entry saying:

`CPack: - package: C:/GitLab-Runner/builds/magjac/graphviz/build/Graphviz-2.44.2~dev.20200810.0719-win64.exe generated.`

## Actual Behaviour

The version part of the filename is 0.1.1:

`CPack: - package: C:/GitLab-Runner/builds/magjac/graphviz/build/Graphviz-0.1.1-win64.exe generated.`

## OS Version

Windows 10.

## Graphviz Version

* Expected: 2.44.2~dev.20200810.0719
* Actual: 0.0.1

## Additional info

If installing using e.g. https://www2.graphviz.org/Packages/development/windows/10/cmake/Release/x64/graphviz-install--win64.exe, Graphviz is installed under /c/Program Files/Graphviz 0.1.1, but the built-in version is still correct:
```
$ which dot
/c/Program Files/Graphviz 0.1.1/bin/dot

magja@DESKTOP-GSDBC95 MINGW64 ~
$ dot -V

dot - graphviz version 2.44.2~dev.20200811.0113 (20200811.0113)
```

This bug was introduced in https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1476/diffs?commit_id=51a96c5e182f509eef2e7fe2c550109816c4bed9.

It turns out that the version used by CPack comes from `GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MAJOR`, `GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MINOR` & `GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_PATCH`. This can be seen [here](https://gitlab.com/magjac/graphviz/-/blob/master/cmake/package_info.cmake#L2). These variables were incorrectly removed by this commit.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-08-11 00:06:01.082-04","2020-08-11 00:08:06.53-04","[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"
1792,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1792","The Windows artifacts produced in CI does not contain the version in the filename","## Steps to reproduce

See e.g. https://www2.graphviz.org/Packages/development/windows/10/cmake/Release/x64/

## Expected Behaviour

The name should be `graphviz-install-2.44.2~dev.20200810.0719-win64.exe`.

## Actual Behaviour

The name is `graphviz-install--win64.exe`.

## OS Version

Windows 10

## Graphviz Version

2.44.2~dev.20200810.0719

## Additional info

It's the same problem for the zip archive produced by the `MSBuild` builds.

~~The reason is that in CI the version used in the filename is set with `$Env:GV_VERSION=$( cat VERSION )` [here](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L91). This does not work in PowerShell.~~

**EDIT:** This problem was introduced in https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/commit/ffc2e8d391a67b1d56459dd7278aa7b96c89e828 which changed from setting `$GV_VERSION` to setting `$Env:GV_VERSION` which are different variables.

I have not analyzed how much these overlap, but I hope we can all agree this is more stack implementations than we would like to maintain.

1794,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1794","test_1767 fails on agread() on Windows","## Steps to reproduce

This issue was discovered by @smattr, see https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1489#note_392218027.

* Remove the skipping of test_1767 on Windows in [rtest/test_regression.py](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/rtest/test_regression.py#L231) as in https://gitlab.com/magjac/graphviz/-/commit/f1571dd7ee2583a352bdb71224be5039c48a2bbb
* Run `pytest -vv -k test_1767 rtest/test_regression.py` on Windows

## Expected Behaviour

Passing test.

## Actual Behaviour

The test fails with exit status 3221226505, but no other error messages.

## OS Version

Windows 10

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.44.2~dev.20200812.0541 (20200812.0541)

## Additional info

* printf-debugging shows that the problem occurs when `g = agread(file, 0);` is executed the first time.
* If the program is changed to read the same DOT source from stdin instead, it runs the first pass without problems and prints out the clusters, but since stdin is drained it cannot run a second pass.
* Modifying the program to just read the original file with fgets() and print the contents works without problems.

I'm puzzled; why can't agread read an already opened file from the file system, but has no problem to read the same contents from `stdin` when `fgets()` has no problem reading the same file?

Home-built 2.44.2~dev.20200813.1227 based on commit https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/commit/ce10e7e1c3c155c1c077c756511dac5ebe90140d

## Additional info

Presumably this happens for all Windows CMake builds and possibly for CMake builds on other OSs as well.

I have no idea why this happens only when using `bison --debug`. Why not always?

The offending code looks like this:

#if LONG_MAX > INT_MAX
typedef int Exshort_t;
#else
typedef short Exshort_t;
#endif
```

Perhaps reasonable except this header does not include limits.h, so neither `LONG_MAX` nor `INT_MAX` are in scope. As a result, the wrong path of this conditional is selected on e.g. x86-64. Compounding the issue, the correct path is chosen if someone including this header happened to include limits.h prior. This can cause different translation units to see a different underlying type for `Exshort_t`, something that will be caught by neither the compiler nor the linker.

This was noted by @smattr in https://forum.graphviz.org/t/windows-x86-x86-64-builds/305.

1806,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1806","replace sed steps on generated parsers with api.prefix","Creating an issue to more accurately track a discussion stemming out of !1523...

Several of the steps that generate lexers/parsers using Flex/Bison run a subsequent `sed` step to find-and-replace ""yy"" with a custom prefix. The purpose of this is to avoid symbol clashes between different generated parsers.

These `sed` steps are both fragile and over-eager (they end up replacing ""yy"" in comments etc), but they are also not necessary. At the time this code was written there was probably no other convenient way of accomplishing this. But today Flex provides [`%option prefix`](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cr4bd/flex-manual/Code_002dLevel-And-API-Options.html) and Bison provides [`%define api.prefix`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Multiple-Parsers.html) for this purpose. Moving to these would make the build more robust, remove some unnecessary intermediate files, and take us one step towards dropping `sed` as a build dependency.

Quoting my last comment from !1523:

This tells me nothing further useful either, but cross-referencing with the autotools build system I think it was copied from configure.ac:89-97:

```sh

Used also for Linux/macOS CMake builds","The version of `getopt` in [windows/getopt](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/tree/master/windows/getopt) is outdated. It's incompatible with the version that the Linux autotools builds use. The fix for https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1561 in commit https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1561/diffs?commit_id=997e12cf45ddfb44d1019c05f05bf12b53bd7322 shows this incompatibility.

Also, this outdated version is used by the CMake builds, regardless of which operating system you're on. I discovered this the hard way by an accidental (details provided on a need-to-know basis :flushed: ) removal of `windows/getopt` in [this Ubuntu CMake job](https://gitlab.com/magjac/graphviz/-/jobs/729861596).

My plan right now is to:

1. Remove `windows/getopt`
1. Add `getopt` using `vcpkg` to the [windows/dependencies/libraries](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz-windows-dependencies) submodule
1. Adapt the CMake builds to:
    1. Use the vcpkg version on Windows
    1. Use the native/Docker image version on Linux and hope that this also works on macOS
1. Adapt the MSBuild builds to use the vcpkg version

The current libraries in [windows/dependencies/libraries](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz-windows-dependencies) has unclear origins, but I read in [this issue](https://github.com/ellson/MOTHBALLED-graphviz/issues/1218#issuecomment-323947968) that many probably comes from https://windows.php.net/downloads/.

My plan is to add a new `vcpkg` top level directory to [windows/dependencies/libraries](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz-windows-dependencies) so that libraries can be installed there directly without the need to figure out which file to put where in the old structure. In future, we can replace other outdated packages in the old structure with new ones installed with `vcpkg`.

**I would very much like to hear your comments on this and the above.**

As a reference, these are the `getopt` files that are installed with vcpkg:

Lefty contains something like a syscall table in cmd/left/internal.c, `Ifuncs`. It looks like it's trying to implement some kind of platform abstraction akin to an OS personality. One of these syscalls is named ""openio"" which is implemented in `Iopenio`. If you follow through a few calls, you'll eventually arrive at `ptyopen` which initially caught my attention because it was mentioned in the following Coverity warnings on #1464:

```

At first glance, I was inclined to agree with Coverity. In fact, these calls to `dup` look useless. The return value — which is the entire point of `dup` — is ignored. Then I realized what's happening here is that the calling code is relying on the low numbered file descriptor it has just closed to be immediately reused in the `dup` call. E.g. it's assuming `close(0), dup(...)` will return `0`. The whole thing is further obfuscated by unnecessary use of the comma operator.

I'm opening this as an issue rather than simply fixing it because we have some decisions to make as to which level of abstraction we solve this at. At a coarse grained level as I see it, from lowest to highest:

1. Fix in minimal number of characters: replace this dance with `dup2`.
2. +1 level: replace the use of `fork` with `posix_spawn` which gives a more structured API for doing such things. Windows compat is maybe affected by this...?
3. +2 levels: replace this with `posix_openpt`. In making this suggestion, I have not actually attempted to grok the precise semantics of this function and am just going off my intuition for what it is doing.
4. +3 levels: remove this lefty ""syscall."" Is it necessary? I do not understand enough to know.
5. +4 levels: remove the lefty syscall table. Maybe whatever it is trying to accomplish is unnecessary or out-of-date.

Open to thoughts and ideas from anyone.

Appendix on fork...

For non-C-programmers, the above may be very confusing and it may be thoroughly unobvious what the code in question is trying to do. The code is (IMHO, correctly) not commented much because it is performing a familiar (to C programmers) sequence of operations:

1. Use `pipe` or a cousin to create some uni-directional in-memory FIFOs.
2. Call `fork` to split execution (and the caller's address space). Note that the code after this point is running *twice*, once in the ""child"" an once in the ""parent.""
3. In the child, use `dup` (or in more modern code, `dup2`) to replace your own `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` with ends of the previously created FIFOs. The intent here is that your input and output is communicated to your parent (the original process) not the user's terminal.
4. In both parent and child close the ends of the FIFOs you don't need. E.g. the child does not need the ""write"" end of the `stdin` FIFO and the parent does not need the ""read"" end of the `stdin` FIFO.
5. In the child, call `execve` or a cousin to bootstrap into another program.

AFAIK there have really only been two significant innovations of this idiom since ~80s:

1. While creating the FIFOs, create an extra one and mark this `O_CLOEXEC`. In the child, if `execve` fails, write a byte to this FIFO. In the parent, read from this FIFO as your first step. The parent's read call will block until either (a) the child successfully execs, unblocking the parent's read call and returning an error, or (b) the parent's read call returns with a byte (which you can ignore) indicating the child failed. This trick solves the problem of ""did the child's exec call fail?""
2. `posix_spawn`. This neatly (well, ish) wraps up the idiom in a few ahead-of-time calls that let you indicate more of your intent to libc. The main advantage of this is that it lets libc do optimization tricks, like call `vfork` when available. `posix_spawn` is always preferred to `fork` in modern C.

If you're coming from a Python world, this is what Python's subprocess module is doing under the hood.

This is a bit of a rambling account and I am less familiar with the history than other maintainers, so I would love to be corrected on any of the above if this is inaccurate.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-09-13 00:03:39.409-04","2020-10-19 00:02:46.369-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

1841,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1841","Graphviz.Graph/Graphviz.DiGraph is unusable after pydot.graph_from_dot_file()","The ability to use DOT files is no longer supported by Graphviz 2.40.1 (Debian Buster), if using the latest PyDot (v1.4.1) approach to load its DOT file.

I suspect the problem to be at `graphviz.Graph`/`graphviz.DiGraph`.

What's really scary is that when using the Python debugger in PyCharm IDE (by JetBrain), Python exception error messages got written (OVER?) into the `Graphviz.source` string.

## Steps to reproduce

Run
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import graphviz
import pydot
print('PyDot version:', pydot.__version__)
print('Graphviz version:', graphviz.version())

DotG = pydot.graph_from_dot_file('Digraph.gv')
print('DotG:', DotG[0])  # prints out original file content

# Now, convert PyDot Graph into a Graphviz Graph type
GvDotG = graphviz.Digraph(DotG)
print('GvDotG.engine:', GvDotG.engine)
print('GvDotG.render:', GvDotG.render)
print('GvDotG.strict:', GvDotG.strict)
print('GvDotG.directed:', GvDotG.directed)
print('GvDotG.comment:', GvDotG.comment)
print('GvDotG.directory:', GvDotG.directory)
print('GvDotG.encoding:', GvDotG.encoding)
print('GvDotG.filename:', GvDotG.filename)
print('GvDotG.filepath:', GvDotG.filepath)
print('GvDotG.graph_attr:', GvDotG.graph_attr)
print('GvDotG.name:', GvDotG.name)
print('GvDotG.format:', GvDotG.format)
# so far, so good.

# But fails on next three lines
print('GvDotG.source:', GvDotG.source)  # BOOM!
print('GvDotG:', GvDotG)  # doesn't work here also (alias of GvDotG.source?)
GvDotG.edge('Hello', 'World')  # also fails here, graph is rendered unusable?
```

## Expected Behaviour

I expect the `graphviz.Digraph(DotG)` to provide a Graphviz-compliant `Graph` type variable so that this `Graph` can be used by other functions provided by Graphviz.

Following 3 lines should be working.

```python
print('GvDotG.source:', GvDotG.source)  # BOOM!
print('GvDotG:', GvDotG)  # doesn't work here also (alias of GvDotG.source?)
GvDotG.edge('Hello', 'World')  # also fails here, graph is rendered unusable?
```

## Actual Behaviour

Instead, it errors all similarly for 3 test lines here:
```python
print('GvDotG.source:', GvDotG.source)  # BOOM!
print('GvDotG:', GvDotG)  # doesn't work here also (alias of GvDotG.source?)
GvDotG.edge('Hello', 'World')  # also fails here, graph is rendered unusable?

The prototype for it already looks a little out of place, as it doesn't take a `GVJ_t`. Its implementation ignores the `size` argument and contains an assertion that looks like a typo:

```c
size_t gvfwrite (const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
{
    size = sizeof(char);
    assert(size);
    return gvwrite((GVJ_t*)stream, ptr, nmemb);

I guess maybe this function is provided for users who need a fwrite-alike function pointer to pass to something else. But this isn't going to work because of the way it ignores `size`.

The new version numbering was introduced with https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1476.

The background was discussed in https://forum.graphviz.org/t/version-numbering-going-forward/237.

It is not clear to me why the new version numbering causes the above mentioned problems. There was a problem with using `-` that was the original idea, but changing it to `~` seemed to be ok, see https://forum.graphviz.org/t/version-numbering-going-forward/237/16.

In https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1592 and https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1608 many tools were adapted to GNU getopt. See e.g. https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1592/diffs?commit_id=2c6420be0dfc252b7db4207accf40af2170c50e8 or https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1608/diffs?commit_id=81852ca7b3eea614752c8d38230562a9027efe89.

macOS however, does not use GNU getopt, but BSD getopt where the `optopt` variable behaves slightly differently and the code prior the the changes mentioned above is the correct one. Therefore, the code needs to be different depending on which OS it it running on.

The tools that are currently failing the tools test on macOS are:
* bcomps
* ccomps
* cluster
* dijkstra
* edgepaint
* gc
* gvcolor
* gvmap
* gvpack
* mm2gv
* nop
* sccmap
* tred

All of them may not have been working on macOS before, but at least some of them did.

This problem should be fixed before the next stable release.

## Steps to reproduce

E.g. `bcomps -?`

## Expected Behaviour

Show usage and exit status zero.

## Actual Behaviour

Output:
```
bcomps: option -? unrecognized

  -t - emit block-cutpoint tree

The 2.38 graph fits neatly within the specified window size, but the 2.44 graph is slightly too wide and is consequently partially clipped. This misbehavior is observed in both IWebBrowser and Firefox.

## Expected Behaviour

I expect the graph to respect the specified size. This was so in version 2.38, and is not so in 2.44. Comparing the two SVG files shows that they are significantly different. Based on this comparison, I surmise that the SVG layout engine has changed and that the change is causing the incorrect sizing.

## Actual Behaviour

The input file, correct and incorrect SVG files, and screenshots are attached to this report.

## OS Version

Windows 7 64-bit.

## Graphviz Version

I'm reporting this issue for version 2.44.1. I don't know exactly which version introduced the issue. All I can say for sure is that version 2.38 does NOT exhibit the issue. I can also confirm that the issue occurs with both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of 2.44.1.

The command line was:

dot -Ksvg -o""xxx"" ""yyy""

where xxx is the output SVG file path and yyy is the input dot file path. All other options are specified in the dot file.

I'm running the latest window build, and have also tested on 
[GraphViz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline) with identical results. I am using the following dot code:

```
digraph graphname 
{
	splines=ortho;
	1 [ width=1, height=1, shape=rect ];
	2 [ width=1, height=1, shape=rect ];
	3 [ width=3, height=3, shape=rect ];
	4 [ width=1, height=1, shape=rect ];
	5 [ width=1, height=1, shape=rect ];
	1 -> 2[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	1 -> 3[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	1 -> 4[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	2 -> 4[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	2 -> 5[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	3 -> 4[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	3 -> 5[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
	4 -> 5[arrowhead=None, headport=n, tailport=s];
}
```

This provides the following output:

![index](/uploads/d2b6efe962c5079891196a2232ff360b/index.png)

Notice that the port (n) for node 5 is not respected. However, removing splines=ortho works just fine:

![index2](/uploads/52bb9887ac2e0aad8f322582ba6ef84a/index2.png)

## Expected Behaviour

I would be expecting the edges 2->5 and 3->5 to travel straight down, turn 90 degrees left and right respectively, continue on and turn in the opposite direction to reach the top of node 5 (excuse the crudity):

The reason seems to be that qt4 is used but qt5 is required.

If I do

```
/usr/bin/qmake -o qMakefile gvedit.pro
make
```

it works.

I experienced the problem with jpg and png output. I do not get the error with pdf, svg or dot. Converting the dot to jpg gave the same error.

I tried changing the DPI, but that didn't help.

The PDF version is 193.54 inches (16.13 feet) by 217.18 inches (16.13 feet by 18.10 feet). At 96 DPI, that would be 18,579 x 20,849 pixels. At 24 bits per pixel, that comes out to just over 1 GB uncompressed size.

The graph will work with jpg if I limit the size to 6 feet by 8 feet at 96 DPI.

* `xml_string` and friends in cmd/tools/gv2gxl.c
* `xml_string` and friends in cmd/smyrna/smyrna_utils.c
* `xml_string` and friends in lib/common/labels.c
* `html_string` and friends in plugin/core/gvrender_core_vml.c

The identical comments surrounding these implementations make it clear they were once copy-pasted from the same source. The lib/common one looks like the original and a comment in Smyrna even explains why this situation exists:

```c
/* many of these functions are available in libcommon.
 * We cannot use those because dependencies cause a great
 * deal of libcommon to be brought in, which complicates
 * and makes possible conflicts as some parts of libcommon
 * rely on not using libcgraph.
 */
```

As far as I'm aware, this situation no longer exists. libcgraph is the only graph library supported and there is no sensible way to use libcommon without libcgraph. However, a naive attempt to undo the Smyrna code duplication fails because:
1. A number of libcommon headers rely on something else being #included prior to them. lib/common/utils.h that contains the libcommon prototype for `xml_string` cannot be #included without other libcommon headers being #included prior to it.
2. A number of libcommon typedefs/prototypes conflict with other ones in Smyrna headers.

The situation is pretty messy and may require diagnosing and undoing the conflicting definitions one-by-one. But I think it's worth doing in service of paring back the number of XML string escaping variants we're maintaining to 1.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-11-06 00:07:38.033-05","2021-11-06 00:02:43.581-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

The problem occurs also for `outlineWidth` and `style` in the GML file.

The problem was found using `-Wall` which produced the following warnings:

1. `sfstropen` and friends in lib/ast/sfstr.h
2. `agxbuf` functions in lib/cgraph/agxbuf.h

These are both analogues of [`open_memstream`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open_memstream.html).

(1) is implemented in terms of `sfnew` and encumbered by a lot of the SFIO implementation details, which are irrelevant for in-memory buffers. In contrast, (2) is about as clean and minimal as it's possible to get for something like this.

I think we should move towards deprecating `sfstropen` and migrate all existing uses to `agxbuf` functionality.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2020-11-15 00:03:19.73-05",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"
1874,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1874","private inheritance in IncVPSC","The class `IncVPSC` in lib/vpsc privately inherits from `VPSC`. However the library uses `IncVPSC` objects as if they can be substituted for `VPSC` objects. The main obvious case is `newIncVPSC`:

```cpp
VPSC* newIncVPSC(int n, Variable* vs[], int m, Constraint* cs[]) {
  return (VPSC*)new IncVPSC(n,vs,m,cs);
}
```

Note that a C-style cast is needed to force this operation here because `VPSC` is an inaccessible base of `IncVPSC`. I.e. you're not supposed to convert `IncVPSC` pointers to `VPSC`. This is exposed to users because this function is part of the lib/vpsc API.

This looks like some sort of kludge that was introduced when bridging this functionality to C.

Version 2.44.1 works as expected.

Only happens with fdp. sfdp, neato, twopi, dot, circo, patchwork & osage do not raise an assertion, but some still show graphviz/graphviz#1876.

The assertion only seems to happen when the subgraph and the edge point have the same name AND that name starts with `cluster`. Changing either of the two occurrences of `cluster_a` to `cluster_c` prevents the assertion. Changing both occurrences of `cluster_a` to `a` also prevents the assertion.

Maybe caused by a hidden bug that only comes out in combination with the bug causing graphviz/graphviz#1876.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-11-16 00:03:38.025-05","2021-01-12 00:00:33.997-05","[""bug"", ""release blocker""]","[]","[]","[]"

Since the `ND_rank` of the node is equals to `0`, the variable `r` is set to `-1`. And then `GD_rank(g)[r]` is crashing.

The call stack looks like: `flat_limits()` called by `flat_node()` called by `flat_edges()` called by `dot_position()`.

`flat_node()` is called from `flat_edges()` because there is a label on the edge.

```

## Expected Behaviour

The output above but with `52.667` replaced with `53.333`, such that the right sides of the rectangles align.
Note that the coordinate `52.667` also doesn't occur in the `_draw_` attribute. Hence, when viewing the svg export, all seems well.

Windows

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.44.2~dev.20201112.1525 (20201112.1525)

## Additional info

The odd thing is that if I pass the outputted dot string above into dot.exe again and output the xdot result, the rectangles align properly.

-1073741819
```
How can I get dot to work consistently?

Graphviz is version 2.44.1. The intermittent crashing is happening on both mac and windows and with other dot files. I've been debugging from a custom program (gvlayout.cpp) that calls graphviz, but the crash happens with the shipped version of dot too (as shown above).

It looks like crash depends on the dictionary order. In collapse_sets (graphviz/lib/dotgen/rank.c) if the rank_set_class returns 0 first, then collapse_sets is called recursively. In the second call, rank_set_class returns 7 and make_new_cluster is called with the same subgraph pointer that is stored in the ccs variable of doDot (graphviz/lib/dotgen/dotinit.c). The ccs variable is cleared in dot_cleanup_graph  at the end of doDot, so the subgraph data pointer is null in place_flip_graph_label (graphviz/lib/common/postproc.c) causing a crash with this stack trace:
```
	gvlayout.exe!place_flip_graph_label(Agraph_s * g) Line 706	C
 	gvlayout.exe!place_flip_graph_label(Agraph_s * g) Line 727	C
 	gvlayout.exe!gv_postprocess(Agraph_s * g, int allowTranslation) Line 613	C
 	gvlayout.exe!gvLayoutJobs(GVC_s * gvc, Agraph_s * g) Line 88	C
 	gvlayout.exe!main(int argc, char * * argv) Line 472	C++
```
	
And this exception:
Exception thrown at 0x00007FF74D727ED0 in gvlayout.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x0000000000000018

If the first call to rank_set_class from collapse_sets returns 7, then make_new_cluster does not share a subgraph pointer with ccs and the program runs successfully. 

Here is output from visual studio debugger with some breakpoints printing out variable information. The first is from a crash and the second ran successfully (exact same input). In the crash output the pointer used by the second place_flip_graph_label call has already been cleared by set_data (graphviz/lib/cgraph/rec.c).

## OS Version

Debian

## Graphviz Version

Tested on Graphviz 2.44.1

## Additional info

This dot file in this issue came from a fuzzer, but has been manually simplified. I don't fully understand what the expected behaviour is with nslimit1 = 0 as there's not much [documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:nslimit1) on it, but anything that asserts causes problems when used as a library, batch job, or rpc server.

Here's the backtrace

```
    #7 0x560418ca8c0c in cluster_leader graphviz/v2_44_1/lib/dotgen/rank.c:281:5

    #16 0x560418be19fc in gvLayout graphviz/v2_44_1/lib/gvc/gvc.c:65:9
```

The assert failure can be trivially avoided by changing  nslimit1 to any value greater than 0 in the testfile.

If nslimit1 <= 0 then `rank2` is called with `maxiter=0` causing it to bail early, meaning that there are no suitable nodes for `cluster_leader` to assign as leader.

Ideas:
 * modify `cluster_leader` to pick lowest rank node rather than rank 0.
 * modify `dot2_rank` to force maxiter = 1 if nslimit1 <=0.
 * somehow propagate an error up from `cluster_leader`
 * silently do nothing in `cluster_leader` etc.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2020-12-06 00:06:11.754-05","2022-02-19 00:07:32.982-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

1906,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1906","broken overflow checks in RectArea","Reviewing !1687 led me to notice that Graphviz is unnecessarily carrying two implementations of `RectArea`. This function can be written once in a width-independent way. While working on unifying these two, I realized at least one of the existing overflow checks is broken:

```c
...
  unsigned int area;
...
    long long a_test = area * (r->boundary[i + NUMDIMS] - r->boundary[i]);
    if (a_test > UINT_MAX) {
...
```

The expression `r->boundary[i + NUMDIMS] - r->boundary[i]` has type `int` and is promoted to `unsigned int` for the multiplication. Unsigned multiplication wraps. Therefore, `area * (r->boundary[i + NUMDIMS] - r->boundary[i])` can never be greater than `UINT_MAX`.

I committed what I believe is a fix in [a branch](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/commit/4f53ff1fec0b442e68b3eb05584240df4661e304). However, it failed CI. Investigating leads me to conclude the graph rtest/graphs/root.gv actually triggers this overflow but has never been noticed before because the check is broken as described above.

You can see this by applying the following diff to the head of master, 3bd29ccadbd9b41a2d6c41034d5ce739fb13decc:

```diff

There are numerous `area`, `r->boundary[i + NUMDIMS] - r->boundary[i]` pairs in this log whose product exceeds `UINT_MAX` but the overflow error message is not triggered on master. It *is* triggered after applying my commit from above.

Title elements should not have changed between versions. In viewers like chrome, the title is used as a tooltip, and provides accessibility (e.g. when rendered with small fonts).

## Actual Behaviour

Title elements have been replaced with anonymous ids. This likely relates to the fix for #1767

## OS Version

Debian linux.

## Additional info

It's worth noting that running this in plain dot doesn't suffer the same problem, which might indicate why this change hasn't been picked up in regression tests. Under plain, there are still additional : in edge titles. Possibly related to !1527 ?

Notation: single nodes on either end of a hyperedge represented as now. For `dihypergraph`, tails and heads would be grouped with `()`, which are currently a syntax error. For `hypergraph`, all the nodes would simply be in a `()`.

For undirected, a single one would be a self-loop, since undirected hyperedges are conceptually a set, and that's the only meaningful mapping to a self-loop.

When trying to render the following dot file (a representation of a densenet121 network, composed of 300 nodes and 900 edges) the renderer freezes.
[densenet121.dot](/uploads/be8a8aacfaf83ea34d6b522cb67d779e/densenet121.dot)

It freezes when using the dot command line tool, and when using it as a C++ library when the gvLayout() function is called.
Other dot graph have no issues rendering, even with a larger number of nodes and edges.

## Expected Behaviour

No freezing, rendering in less than 5 seconds.

The Graphviz tree contains exactly three usages of the POSIX regular expression API (regex.h): ./lib/gvc/gvconfig.c, ./lib/gvc/gvusershape.c, and ./cmd/smyrna/btree.c. The first two look trivial and the last one looks like it's not even used as a regex. To support these three uses, we take a dependency on RxSpencer because Windows does not support this API.

Would it be an improvement to refactor these to not use regexes at all and then drop the RxSpencer dependency?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-01-13 00:00:47.025-05","2021-02-21 00:09:05.48-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Download a clean graphviz on a macOS system. 
Use `cmake -G Xcode ..` and `cmake --build build` (in correct folders)

## Expected Behaviour

Full build :-)

## Actual Behaviour

It doesn't compile. I have identified so far several reasons: 
- wrong bison version (see https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1916#additional-info)
- Xcode not able to handle OBJECT libraries (see [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html), where under Object Libraries is says: Some native build systems (such as Xcode) may not like targets that have only object files, so consider adding at least one real source file to any target that references $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>.) 

The cmake/Xcode problem manifests itself in two ways: 
1. Wrong compile order (first compile complains some object files missing), see here:

Command Ld failed with a nonzero exit code
```
2. The first problem can be fixed just by executing the build a few times until all object files are created! Then compilation fails because of the missing 'libcommon.a' during compilation of `tred`. Indeed, the library isn't produced. Instead of `build/lib/common/Debug/libcommon.a` the build process produces `build/lib/common/Graphviz.build/Debug/common_obj.build/libcommon_obj.a`. See error message here: 
```

## OS Version

macOS 11.1 Big Sur (on ""Apple Silicon"")

## Graphviz Version

current developer snapshot 

## Additional info

To compile common as object codes seems to be at least for the current cmake build superfluous: https://forum.graphviz.org/t/cmake-creates-common-library-as-object-library/500/10?u=vithanco 

My straightforward suggestion would be to merge common and gvc - at least for the cmake branch. But I expect this to be controversial. 

The alternative is to move at least one `.c` file to the static build. I created an empty `dummy.c` file and added it to the CMakeLists.txt:
add_library(common STATIC
    $<TARGET_OBJECTS:common_obj>
    dummy.c # new addition in order to avoid Xcode problem
)

That works fine. 

I would expect that if the cmake branch will be further developed that we will run into the sam issues with the other OBJECT library pack.

## Next Steps

I will present a MR for these two issues soon, which will add the script needed for BISON and a dummy file for Xcode in common and pack. Any comments on this?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-01-16 00:01:29.579-05","2021-09-15 00:00:26.017-04","[""macos""]","[]","[]","[]"

- Compile graphviz for mac on x86_64 architecture as static libraries
- use this function to load 
```
GVC_t * loadGraphvizLibraries() {
    GVC_t * gvc =  gvNEWcontext(&lt_preloaded_symbols[0], 4);
    gvAddLibrary(gvc, &gvplugin_dot_layout_LTX_library);

}
```
- run the app with all kind of sanitisers and checks. 

## Expected Behaviour

Graphviz ready to layout. 

## Actual Behaviour

The loading fails. It claims an stack-use-after-return error. If I understand the message correctly, then the problem steams from `gvplugin_install`. However, I cannot see the issue.

I'm using large DOT graph to check the consistency of large genealogical trees. Most of times I don't need to print the tree, so that I don't use the SIZE command, with the purpose of obtaining a ""natural size"" graph.
Actually the graph seems to be in ""natural size"" horizontally, I mean it grows without constraints horizontally. In vertical direction, instead, the graph appears to be limited in a way I can't explain. 
Usually I select the .pdf output format, but the problem is the same with the .jpg format.

Even though the graph is specified with ordering=out and the cross-references have constraint=false, their presence still changes the ordering of the subgraph of specific nodes.

[thefile.dot](/uploads/ed434f6e7c24f198b4368a7cfa586214/usefulexample.c.typed.dot)


## Steps to reproduce

render the attached file.
Then run `grep -vwE ""(constraint)"" thefile.dot > newfile.dot` and render `newfile.dot`

## Expected Behaviour

The graphs should look the same (ignoring the removed edges)

## Actual Behaviour

The graphs do not look the same, more specifically the ordering of the nodes under the top-level node is wrong.

1924,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1924","Question about userout() function in agerror.c","I am using GraphViz as a library and calling the graph functions in my application to generate an SVG rendering of DOT data which is passed to `agmemread()` as described in the PDF documentation `libguide.pdf` and `Agraph.pdf`. I would like to capture the errors or warnings in my application instead of having them written to `stderr`. To do this, I can set a custom callback function `agseterrfunc()` as described on p. 12 of the latter PDF file. The function is typedef'd like this:
```
typedef int (*agusererrf) (char*);
agusererrf agseterrf(agusererrf);
```

Two questions arise:

(1) There is a dynamically allocated buffer which is passed as a `char*` to the user's custom error function, if set. If the text to be written is larger than the buffer, it is grown. However, it appears that this buffer is never freed unless the call to `realloc()` failed. Does this happen automatically when the library is unloaded or the application quits?

(2) What value(s) should my function return (an `int` is required)?

1928,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1928","Out-of-bounds write caused by incorrect error handling of malloc in genUserdata (gxl2gv.c:152)","gxl2gv is vulnerable to OOB write when opening GXL file after exhausting the memory pool.

Incorrect handling of the value returned by malloc in genUserdata may lead to:
- out-of-bound write attempt and segmentation fault error in case of restrictive memory protection,
- near NULL pointer overwrite in case of limited memory restrictions (e.g. in embedded environments).

Memory allocations are triggered during opening GXL files, so the allocation error can be caused locally or remotely depending on the way of obtaining files.
In some embedded environments near zero memory areas are used to store device configuration, so in this case such configuration can be overwritten using this vulnerability.

Vulnerable code (gxl2gv.c):

	 51: #define NEW(t)      malloc(sizeof(t))

	150: static userdata_t *genUserdata(void)
	151: {

	155:     agxbinit(&(user->composite_buffer), SMALLBUF, 0);

## Steps to reproduce

The issue can be reproduced and tested using ErrorSanitizer (https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer).

0. Install gdb

1. Download and unpack code of ErrorSanitizer (https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer)

2. Perform compilation of ErrorSanitizer according to the manual (https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer#compilation)

	cd ErrorSanitizer; make

3. Set ESAN to the path of ErrorSanitizer directory

	export ESAN=/opt/...

4. Download attached map temp_1.cur_input
[temp_1.cur_input](/uploads/12f4afe6b485dc12ec2063fb9da946ae/temp_1.cur_input)

5. Download and compile graphviz (after compilation with symbols gdb results will be more readable)

6. Run gxl2gv test program example with ErrorSanitizer in gdb using:

	gdb -batch -ex='run' -ex='backtrace' -ex='backtrace full' --args env LD_PRELOAD=$ESAN/error_sanitizer_preload.so ./gxl2gv temp_1.cur_input

You should receive similar output:

I don't see anything in the changelog that would lead me to expect this (although https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/165 might be related) 

## Expected Behaviour

I would expect these labels to continue to have multiple lines, although http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#k:escString isn't clear on the behaviour.

If this was an intentional change in behaviour, then an update to documentation and mention in the changelog would be warranted.

Download  stable_windows_10_msbuild_Release_Win32_graphviz-2.46.0-win32.zip, unzip it and run dot.exe on a clean, fresh Windows 10.

## Expected Behaviour

Should work.

## Actual Behaviour

Doesn't work due to the missing library vcruntime140.dll, which should be included in the zip.

## OS Version

Windows, win32 "".zip"" version

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.46.0 (20210118.1747)

## Additional info

- The library vcruntime140.dll is usually already available on developer machines, as it is part of the Visual Studio installation (of course) and then already installed in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. That's the reason why a developer can't reproduce / won't notice that problem.
- looking from dot.exe, the dependency to that file is through all dependend .dll to that .dll, including dot.exe itself.
- The missing file is distributed in the installer package stable_windows_10_cmake_Release_x64_graphviz-install-2.46.0-win64.exe. So you don't have any problem if you install graphviz with that.
- Since it is already included in the x64 installer, I guess that's not a licensing problem to include that in the .zip distribution too. If it is, I would rather guess to remove the dependency from the build generally, also from the x64 build.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-01-30 00:00:38.845-05","2021-09-15 00:05:12.454-04","[""windows""]","[]","[]","[]"
1933,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1933","pseudo-float parsing doesn't work","The function `strton` is a `strtol` analogue, but also recognizes various suffixes as multipliers:

```c
/* ...
 *  multiplier: .   pseudo-float (100) + subsequent digits
 *      [bB]    block (512)
 *      [cC]    char (1)
 *      [gG]    giga (1024*1024*1024)
 *      [kK]    kilo (1024)
 *      [mM]    mega (1024*1024)
 */
```

The function appears to do what it says on the box, but its only caller in the Graphviz tree (lib/expr/extoken.c) misuses it:

```c
        if (c == 'u' || c == 'U')
        {
          q = UNSIGNED;
          c = lex(ex);
          exlval.integer = strtoull(s, &e, b);
        }
        else
          exlval.integer = strtoll(s, &e, b);
        if (*e)
        {
          *--e = 1;
          exlval.integer *= strton(e, &e, NiL, 0);
        }
```

This code parses something like ""100k"" by parsing the number itself with `strtoll`, stepping backwards and overwriting the input so it looks like ""101k"", and then re-parsing from offset 2 with `strton`, producing the multiplier `1024` and then final value `102400`.

The example I've just described works, but consider what happens if we try to use the ""pseudo-float"" suffix. An input of ""100.42"" will be parsed by `strtoll` as `100` and then the call to `strton` will yield `142` which is then treated as a multiplier, resulting in `14200`. This is clearly not what the user intended.

My interpretation is that this is broken and we should probably remove the pseudo-float functionality. Given this is the only call to `strton`, I think we should remove this entire function and replace it with a simpler one to parse an optional single character suffix. Note that `strton` also supports numerous suffixes not described in its leading comment.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-01-31 00:01:36.002-05","2021-02-13 00:02:32.148-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

The loop counter is never used, so the body of the loop is a no-op after the first iteration.

It's not obvious to me what this code is attempting to accomplish. It uses the global `dim` that is not declared `const` but whose value is always `4`. However, the functions are called from `nearest_neighbor_graph_ann` that takes a custom `dim` value from its caller. It looks to me as if the bodies of the nested loops were coded to assume `dim` is always `4` but also ignore their containing loop.

What is the right fix here? It looks like the functions to reach this are not in any shipped header and Graphviz itself only calls into this code with `dim == 4`. So maybe we should just remove `dim` as a parameter and remove the inner loops?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-02-07 00:09:50.861-05","2021-02-20 00:09:21.609-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Additional info

The problem is things like `c`, `C`, and `P` that are invalid JSON. The right way to do this would be to wrap these in quotes so they were strings. This stems from `jsonXDot_Op` in lib/xdot/xdot.c.

I don't know quite what to make of this, because this clearly isn't a typo but intentional. Is this not the expected way to use xdot?

However, when the Docker images *are* rebuilt you end up in a situation where the Ubuntu 18.04 image rebuild has completed, the portable source task has completed, but the Ubuntu 18.04 build task won't start because it's waiting for the other Docker rebuild tasks to finish.

At first glance, the preceding `c == …` of the many branches in this code look like another `strcmp` micro-optimization.

I first thought this was intentional for some kind of getopt-like behavior where it accepts prefixes of valid options. But note that ""de"" is an ambiguous prefix (prefix of both ""debug"" and ""delete"") but will match ""debug"" anyway.

## Steps to reproduce

I rendered the following graph (which is the cluster demo graph with a small modification to add margins to cluster_1)

```
digraph G {

	subgraph cluster_0 {
		style=filled;
		color=lightgrey;
		node [style=filled,color=white];
		a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
		label = ""process #1"";
	}

	subgraph cluster_1 {
		node [style=filled];
		b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
		label = ""process #2"";
		color=blue
		margin=""50,0""
	}
	start -> a0;
	start -> b0;
	a1 -> b3;
	b2 -> a3;
	a3 -> a0;
	a3 -> end;
	b3 -> end;

	start [shape=Mdiamond];
	end [shape=Msquare];
}
```

## Expected Behaviour

According to the [documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:margin) I should be able to specify vertical and horizontal margins to a cluster, passing a point instead of a scalar. 

So in this example I would expect cluster_1 to have 50 as horizontal margin and 0 as vertical margin.

## Actual Behaviour

It is only taking the first attribute of the point as margin, applying 50 to the vertical and horizontal margin.

1. Given the following graph:

[tooltip_example.gv](/uploads/8952566996018d6f9063f82689642827/tooltip_example.gv)

```
digraph  {
  node1 -> node2 [label=""via tooltip, no URL"", tooltip=""this is a tooltip, via tooltip!""]
  node1 -> node2 [label=""via tooltip, with URL"", URL=""https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz"", tooltip=""this is a tooltip, via tooltip!""]
  node1 -> node2 [label=""via edgetooltip"", edgetooltip=""this is a tooltip, via edgetooltip!""]
  node1 -> node2 [label=""via labeltooltip"", labeltooltip=""this is a tooltip, via labeltooltip!""]
}
```

2. Convert it to an SVG: `dot -Tsvg tooltip_example.gv -o tooltip_example.svg`

3. Load the SVG into a web browser to hover with the mouse above each edge and each of their labels, to view their tooltips.

![tooltip_example.svg](/uploads/84a62fe7e463bc06f08875e7ccaff9ae/tooltip_example.svg)

## Expected Behaviour

The edges with an `edgetooltip` and `labeltooltip` should show tooltips only on their edge or label, respectively. The two edges defined with a `tooltip` should show tooltips on both their edges and labels, because the label is part of the edge.

## Actual Behaviour

- Good: The edges with an `edgetooltip` or `labeltooltip` behave as expected. Note that this is in constrast to the documentation (https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:edgetooltip and https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:labeltooltip), because supposedly these tooltips should only appear if there's a `URL` defined. Please don't change this behavior! Why should it even matter whether there's a URL? For my use cases, sometimes I don't have a URL but I still want to show a tooltip..

- Good: The contents of `tooltip` is indeed always applied to the edge itself (best checked by hovering above the arrows).

- **Bad**: The contents of `tooltip` is never applied to the edge's label, however the label _does_ receive a tooltip containing the contents of the label, if there's a `URL` defined for that edge. Not only is this redundant (why show the same thing twice?), but also a bit confusing because it's not showing the standard contents.

Long story short, the only way to show a tooltip also on the label for an edge is to define both the `tooltip` (or `edgetooltip`) as well as its `labeltooltip`. It's not a critical bug, but very annoying for maintenance/development.

## Documentation Fix

From the `attrs.html` page, remove both of the following sentences, because they aren't true (nor should they be):

1. For `edgetooltip` remove the sentence `Used only if the edge has a URL or edgeURL attribute.`

2. For `labeltooltip` remove the sentence `Used only if the edge has a URL or labelURL attribute.`

I have a new Python build in /usr/sup/Python-3.9.2.  Based on https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1693, I built a new version of swig, as my existing one is quite old; it's in /usr/sup/swig-4.0.2.  There is nothing in /usr/local.

## Steps to reproduce

```

## Expected Behaviour

A successful build of graphviz.

## Actual Behaviour

Configure works; make consistently fails with:

A couple of things to say about this:
1. Passing something like `-rabbit` is a no-op (not rejected, but also doesn't do anything). Unclear if this is intentional.
2. When specifying a non-integer to `-random_seed` the error message contradicts the usage text.

The above is one example of a problematic argument, but every command line parameter to edgepaint has some variant of this situation.

I think this should really not be hand rolling its own (incorrect) implementation of `getopt_long`.

1984,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1984","reference counted strings put the HTML bit in the middle of the reference count","This is something I noticed a long time ago and has been on my list of things to fix, but I thought I should actually document the situation.

lib/cgraph/refstr.c implements reference-counted strings with the structure `refstr_t`. Since the initial commit of cgraph, d7767d4b5c511afa89b46798eea4e2f915930844, `HTML_BIT` has been (IMHO incorrectly) set based on `unsigned int` instead of `unsigned long`. Presumably this was not an issue because most machines were 32-bit x86 at the time, where `sizeof(unsigned int) == sizeof(unsigned long)`.

In the transition to x86-64 machines, this setup became awkward. The reference count is 8 bytes wide, but `HTML_BIT` is set to be bit 31. I.e. the bit indicating that a string is HTML is now in the middle of the reference count. A string with ≥ 2³¹ references, something that is possible on an x86-64 machine, now accidentally sets the HTML bit. Note that this ecosystem transition also made the comment about `HTML_BIT` incorrect, `/* msbit of unsigned long */`.

d1244c8001e8c681def4c0ff25a91136845c2a75 did a tree-wide replacement of `unsigned long` with `uint64_t`, which further compounded the situation. Now the HTML bit is in the incorrect position on *both* 32-bit and 64-bit x86.

It's debatable whether this bug has any effect or is latent, because it's effectively masked by another bug, !1857. Nevertheless I think we should fix it.

The cleanest solution is to stop storing two things in one field. We can use a bitfield to implement the correct semantics in a safer way, making the compiler do the shifting and masking for us:

```c
  uint64_t refcnt: sizeof(uint64_t) * 8 - 1;
  uint64_t is_html: 1;
```

It is questionable whether this even needs to be a bitfield, and not simply a `uint64_t` and a `bool`, but I think we should leave this space optimization in place for now.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-03-27 00:01:19.139-04","2021-04-04 00:07:52.546-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

```c
void agrefstrdump(Agraph_t * g)
{
    NOTUSED(g);
    dtwalk(Refdict_default, refstrprint, 0);
}
```

When cross-referencing `refdict` it seems pretty clear this function should be using `g->clos->strdict` if `g` is not `NULL` or maybe calling `refdict` itself. `agrefstrdump` is only for debugging, but it should at least dump the right dictionary.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-03-27 00:00:13.527-04","2021-07-18 00:04:55.482-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

It doesn't seem possible to make ""bus"" nodes in graphviz, such as would be useful for drawing network diagrams.

## Expected Behaviour

It is desired to be able to create a node that looks like a thick line, with the label beneath it, and to which edges can connect anywhere along its length.

## Actual Behaviour

Labels are difficult to draw beneath a purposely resized node to give the impression of a bus.
When this is done, if the node is at the bottom of the page, the label beneath it will be truncated.
Also, all edges still attempt to terminate in the centre of the node, rather than any convenient point along the bus.

2000,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2000","CI Python OSErrors from Windows tasks","I'm seeing some variant of the following error very often in CI. ~50% of my CI runs are failing due to one of the Windows tasks failing in this way. We have six Windows tasks, so this is occurring in ~8% of Windows CI tasks. This may not sound like a lot, but the effect is that I am having to retry every second CI run, some multiple times.

My analysis of the error (please correct me if I've misinterpreted it): the assertion is not failing. The condition is true, but that line is being blamed as where the temporary file destruction is triggered from (exiting the `with` block). Somehow deletion of the temporary directory fails. It looks to me like something else is either (a) racing with the temporary directory deletion or (b) holding an open file handle while the temporary directory deletion is running.

Commence wild speculation:
* This is not Graphviz' fault. This appears to be a fault of Python or the OS.
* I don't want to jump to conclusions, but my suspicion is that this is more Windows nonsense: Windows Defender or some other background scanner operating on the temporary directory/files while Python believes it has exclusive control of them.
* This is not worth our time to debug.

My suggestion: I would like to upgrade the version of Python we're using (3.8) in the hope that smarter people than us have solved/worked-around this in Python itself. @magjac can we drop the Python version from dependencies repo and install Python ≥3.9 from a Gitlab-supported package manager?

* Unit tests based on [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* Test run with [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html), although perhaps `ctest` will be run through `pytest` in CI.
* SVG parsing using [SVG++](http://svgpp.org/) which is based on [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)

The remainder of this description is going to assume you have read the following:
* #205
* !1760
* #1940
* https://forum.graphviz.org/t/use-dllimport-dllexport-and-or-a-def-file-on-windows/620

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exporting-from-a-dll-using-def-files?view=msvc-160
* https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility

So Graphviz (or really any C/C++ app+lib project) needs to manage visibility wrt linkage that is *outside* the C and C++ standards. To reiterate and stress that last part, there is currently no way to control this kind of symbol visibility with ISO standardized mechanisms.¹ Here is the ideal state for the end user, using the GCC visibility terms:

| context | symbol | visibility |
|----|----|----|
| compiling libfoo | `bar`, a symbol only used internally in libfoo | internal |
| compiling libfoo | `baz`, a symbol that is part of libfoo’s API | default | 
| compiling foo, an app that links against libfoo | `baz` | hidden |
| compiling foo | a symbol from foo itself | hidden |

There are a number of ways to control symbol visibility:
1. Command line options, e.g. `-fvisibility…`
2. GNU attributes, `__attribute((visibility(…)))`
3. MSVC `__declspec`
4. MSVC defs file

(1) is not useful for controlling symbol-by-symbol visibility. (2) is understood by GCC and Clang, but not MSVC. (3) is understood by GCC and MSVC, but not Clang.² (4) is hard to keep in sync with the source.

So essentially I think what we want to aim for is something like the following in a library’s API header:

```c
#ifdef FOO_EXPORT
#ifdef _WIN32
#define FOO_API __declspec(dllexport)
#elif defined(__GNUC__)
#define FOO_API __attibute__((visibility(""default"")))
#else
#define FOO_API /* nothing; suboptimal build with everything visible */
#endif
#else
#ifdef _WIN32
#define FOO_API __declspec(dllimport)
#elif defined(__GNUC__)
#define FOO_API __attribute__((visibility(""hidden"")))
#else
#define FOO_API /* nothing; suboptimal build with everything visible */
#endif
#endif
```

where `FOO_EXPORT` is only defined when compiling the library itself. There are some additional complications for C++,³ but for the most part I think this is it. Please comment if you think we should be moving towards something different.

CC @magjac, @compnerd_

¹ Neither `extern` nor `static` is the droid we are looking for.

² However, in practice the GCC interpretation of this is not so useful as e.g. `__declspec(dllimport)` does *not* imply `extern` as it does under MSVC.

³ As https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility discusses, things that need RTTI typically need to be visible across SOs.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-04-26 00:05:50.751-04","2022-01-04 00:01:05.812-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Additional info

I'm the maintainer of graphviz in MacPorts. I have not been able to reproduce the build failure on my macOS 10.13.6 machine, however I am able to confirm that `--tag=CC` is missing when invoking libtool to compile GVTextLayout.m, and all libtool invocations should specify the tag.

I'm not sure because the commit message does not indicate but I think this is the issue that 79aa7d77ef433d66c0142168d2817b4c7014d263 was trying to solve. However there were two problems: the fix was added inside a conditional so that it only takes effect on Darwin 9 (Mac OS X 10.5) when in fact the fix is needed regardless of OS version, and there was a typo in the variable name in the fix so that it does not work even on Darwin 9 (Mac OS X 10.5). I'll submit a PR to fix this shortly.

The result of this is that building with Clang emits repeated warnings about not understanding these two flags. You can see this in the CI macOS Autotools build.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-05-08 00:07:47.657-04","2021-06-26 00:09:45.478-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Looking at this script and how it is run, I have the impression Perl is not necessary. Going further, I would say a script is not necessary. This can probably be accomplished with a regular header or, if not that simple, an [X macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Macro).

Making this change would allow us to drop Perl as a build dependency, delete Perl from the Windows build dependency repo, and generally exit the Perl game altogether.

`ErrorActionPreference` is not toggled before the first conditional, so none of its containing block is run. A problem here just terminates the script. I think it is meant to do the same pattern as the second conditional.

* usages of `grep` within windows/bin/setup-build-utilities.ps1 itself

* usages of `diff` in rtest/rtest.py (these look replaceable by [`difflib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) or even `filecmp`)

## Additional info

`Error: trouble in init_rank` has come up in some other bug reports such as #1939, but this looks different to me.  The conditions are much simpler.  Any graph with 128 or more cluster subgraphs which each contain 1 (or more) `rank=source` node and one (or more) free node.  `rank=sink` is equally problematic.  Edges aren't needed to reproduce.

I am wondering if there is a fix at this point, because this is show stopping for us.

I am trying to get this working on a Mac OS X 11.3.1 with xcode installed. Any help is appreciated.

Last, here's the `diagrams` python code I am working on in this case is the first example in https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples.


## Steps to reproduce

1. Download graphviz 2.47.2 (brew install graphviz).
2. Download diagrams from https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/ using pip3.9 (pip3.9 install diagrams).
3. Run the first example in https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples titled ""grouped workers"" using Python 3.9.


The dot file parsing fails with the above assertion error.

## Expected Behaviour

The png file for the grouped workers is created.

## Actual Behaviour

```
Assertion failed: (sz >= 2), function convertSPtoRoute, file ortho.c, line 155.
[1]    23022 abort      dot -v -Tpng grouped_workers

It outputs the result in one second, and the nodes are densely packed without overlapping.
It should output in less than one second.

## Additional info

The reason for this problem is that the `lib/ortho` object files are not included in the `gvc` library when built with CMake, which has the effect that they end up both in libgvplugin_dot_layout.so and in libgvplugin_neato_layout.so which causes the ASan ODR violation.

When built with autotools, the `gvc` library correctly contains those object files and the problem does not arise.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-07-06 00:03:19.428-04","2021-07-14 00:05:25.294-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Steps to reproduce

Just cherry-pick [this commit][cmake_stderr] in order to add some [`message()`][cmake-message] into `./CMakeLists.txt`

[cmake_stderr]: https://gitlab.com/test.cases/graphviz/-/commit/618de90c2faa618225531c674cd83460f005ae01

## Expected Behaviour

## Actual Behaviour

`cmake` stopped on the way like this (Windows CI):

```
$ python ci/build_windows.py --build-system $env:build_system --platform $Env:project_platform --configuration $env:configuration 2>&1 | tee -a $logfile

```

- The first [message][cmake-message] (to stdout) was properly output.
- But, the second one (to stderr) was not properly output, and seemed to be trapped by PowerShell.

2099,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2099","reduce memory usage of string interning","While working on the recent string-interning-based stuff like #517, #1984, and #2089, I realized the implementation uses more memory than it needs to. An interned string ends up in a struct like the following:

```c
typedef struct {
    Dtlink_t link;
    uint64_t refcnt: sizeof(uint64_t) * 8 - 1;
    uint64_t is_html: 1;
    char *s;
    char store[1];    /* this is actually a dynamic array */
} refstr_t;
```

As the comment indicates, the last member is not really 1 byte but rather a dynamically sized array.¹ When memory is allocated to intern a string, the string's length is taken into account when allocating memory for the backing `refstr_t`. Then the string is written to the `store` member, and the `s` member is set to point to this. `s` is what gets returned to the caller. Later on, struct-field-offset-based arithmetic is used to reconstruct a `refstr_t` pointer from a string pointer.

The wasteful part in here is `s`. It always points to `store`. So we don't actually need `s`, but can just return the address of `store`. On a 64-bit platform this is wasting 8 bytes per interned string. In many graphs, it's possible that the size of the interned string dictionary occupies more memory than just duplicating and not interning strings at all would have.

¹ This kind of thing might look strange when you first come across it, but it is a common pattern for representing header-prefixed dynamic blobs. You often see network code using something like this to represent packet data or protocol libraries using it for Tag-Length-Value (TLV) data. The modern way to do this is actually to declare the array with no length, `[]`, a so-called Variable Length Array In Struct (VLAIS).",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-07-14 00:02:27.876-04","2022-12-26 00:09:38.721-05","[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

Dredging comp.lang archives and Stack Overflow turns up nothing, and the nature of the workaround suggests to me it's not target independent. It looks like working around some kind of register allocator bug.

Anyway, this led me to staring at this code for a while and noticing that integer left shift is pretty clearly incorrectly writing to the `floating` member of the value struct instead of the `integer` member. It's not quite clear to me what the effect of this is as I believe the `floating` member is unioned with the `integer` member.

1. Clone graphviz from gitlab https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/ into ""external"" directory of the project
1. Enter graphviz dir and get everything via _git submodule update --init --recursive_
1. Add environment variable as stated here http://graphviz.org/doc/winbuild.html at the top

2. Configure project
2. Add CmakeLists.txt in project directory

2113,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2113","the neato (mode=hier) implementation may have a redundant step to make the graph acyclic","I'm recently interested in the Digcola paper(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532130) and trying to use Graphviz to reproduce some results in it. Surprisingly, I found that the results produced by neato -Gmode=hier are a bit different from the results in the paper. Through reviewing the source code, I believe an extra acyclic step in neatoinit.c is the cause of this difference.

The author of this algorithm stressed that one of the biggest benefits of it is the ability to handle cyclic digraphs, and it's actually designed to deal with cyclic digraphs, adding an acyclic step seems quite redundant it's affecting the performance of this program. Or is there a specific reason for doing this?

Here are two results by the neato -Gmode=hier command, with and without acyclic step (levelsgap=0.17):

Process with `dot` the following source:

    digraph
    {   {   rank=same
            c->d->e
        }

        subgraph cluster_ab
        {   a b  }

        edge[weight=127]; // try with various values of this weight: 127, 128, 129
        a->c;
        b->e;
    }

specifying various weights for edges `a->c` and` `b->e`.

## Expected Behaviour

As the weight increases, the legths of edges `a->c` and `b->e` gradually decrease.

## Actual Behaviour

The lengths of edges `a->c` and `b->e` remain the same for weights from 1 to
[127](/uploads/bea624bc8b866b469ffea3947ee1bc7b/w_127.png),
then suddenly shorten at weight
[128](/uploads/0101e9b10bfce2ab570b3f91f3f779a3/w_128.png),
and become shotest at weight
[129](/uploads/c6240f8144177a40cf0ca8181ef0a654/w_129.png), that is three steps for the entire continuum of weight values!

Since edge-length optimisation is a smooth procedure optimising a smooth target function, the effect of weight should not be so saltatory.

#### Summary :
Arrows from nodes **a to d**, and **f to c** are missing, apparently **because** these nodes are **side by side horizontally**.

![output.svg](/uploads/e3a9fb192a36c8392715cebd8756f934/output.svg)

#### Reproduce :
Command line used :
~~~
dot -Tsvg graph.dot > output.svg
~~~

With following DOT code in the ""graph.dot"" file:

~~~
digraph Q {

  node [shape=record];

  subgraph cluster_A {
    a -> b -> c
  }
  
  subgraph cluster_B {
    d -> e -> f
  }
  
  // The two arrows between these nodes are missing (when 2 nodes are next to each other, side to side)!
  a -> d
  f -> c
  
  // This arrow appears correctly (nodes are in a diagonal relative position) !
  e -> c

}
~~~

## Expected Behaviour

Arrows should apprear between a -> d and f -> c in the SVG ""output.svg"" file.

## Actual Behaviour

Instead, arrows are missing in the SVG file whenever nodes are side by side horizontally.

## Additional info

In the configure script, the probe for Qt6Core fails because it relies on pkg-config. Qt6 dropped support for pkg-config as they rely on Cmake dependencies instead.

Although graphviz has a working rough draft of a Cmake build, it doesn't include gvedit either.

1. Use dot to create SVG output, and examine it. 

## Expected Behaviour

Find the source code (ready to copy and paste if you want to reproduce in graphviz) as something similar to a comment

## Actual Behaviour

The feature isn't implemented yet, so you won't find the graphviz source code anywhere in the xml file.
(there are plenty of other comments)

## OS Version

irrelevant, but it's MX Linux: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 2.40.1 (20161225.0304)

## Additional info

It would be trivial to do this by inserting above the closing </svg> tag like the following:

```
<!-- Graphviz source: -->
<defs>
<![CDATA[

graph example {
  hello -- world
}

]]>
</defs>
```
It should be trivial to implement by dumping the source between those literals unless maybe ""]]>"" appears in the source, in which case you could warn that the source code is not being output and just skip inserting it. (probably not even worth escaping the pattern for that rare case)

## Use cases

This would allow a person or machine to copy the text verbatim in order to retrieve it from an SVG file.

If the DOT source ever got separated from its SVG output, it could be retrieved from within the output file itself and easily modified by grabbing the dot source from within.

Another use case I had today was I wanted to give someone a SVG file and not confuse them with extra files that were used in creating it, but giving them the opportunity make changes and send it back to me. 

Also when archiving dot programs, they could be archived within SVG files this way and easy to browse and see what they all are.

## Why use CDATA instead of a normal XML comment?

Note that placing the source code in a regular XML comment using ""< ! - -"" and ""- - >"" won't work because SGML/XML/SVG prohibits double-dash in that context, but double-dash appears frequently in graphs.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-09-07 00:02:42.628-04","2021-09-12 00:07:36.62-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Additional info

The issue is that the rpath on macOS seems to be completely wrong. To sketch out a fix, it might look like this for each executable target:

```
if (APPLE)
    cmake_policy(SET CMP0068 NEW)
    set_target_properties(dot PROPERTIES
            BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR off
            BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH on
            INSTALL_RPATH ""${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR}""
            )
endif()
```

This makes sense to me, because the expected behavior is that installing 'dot' anywhere should result in a working binary that does not require fixing the rpaths. And the rpaths should be set to wherever the dylibs were installed.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-09-10 00:09:57.225-04","2022-03-01 00:09:11.471-05","[""macos""]","[]","[]","[]"

This appears to be a side effect of Bison 3.8 becoming available in Homebrew, and CI now installing that instead of 3.7.6. The [Bison changelog](https://github.com/akimd/bison/blob/master/NEWS) has lots of interesting remarks. In particular:

```
  To comply with the latest POSIX standard, in Yacc compatibility mode
  (options `-y`/`--yacc`) Bison now generates prototypes for yyerror and
  yylex.  In some situations, this is breaking compatibility: if the user
  has already declared these functions but with some differences (e.g., to
  declare them as static, or to use specific attributes), the generated
  parser will fail to compile.  To disable these prototypes, #define yyerror
  (to `yyerror`), and likewise for yylex.

## Actual Behaviour

On occasion, the various Graphviz engines will run (much) longer than the user desires.  
Currently, the user can only (mostly) throttle run-time by setting limits on iterations within the primary subsystems (e.g. nslimit and nslimit1).  The relation between iterations and seconds is very murky.

Adding watch-dog timers to the primary subsystems and new attributes to set time maximums would allow the the user to directly limit total run-time (seconds, minutes, or hours) and/or subsystem run-time (seconds, minutes, hours, or percentage) .

I tried to run the code of ""HARP: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Networks"" (https://github.com/GTmac/HARP), but I didn't get the expected results.
The author uses sfdp_linux to produce the graph coarsening.
But when I tried these three standard datasets, I found that the graph was not coarsened.
That is, after the sentence ""recursive_graphs, recursive_merged_nodes = [], read_coarsening_info( temp_dir)"" of the external_ec_coarsening() function in graph_coarsening.py, the recursive_merged_nodes I received is an empty list.
I want to know what happened because this caused the external_ec_coarsening() function to directly return the original graph.

## Expected Behaviour

- **split** & **tokens** commands should ""tokenize"" as documented (tokenize based on delimiters)
- **index** should return index of search string in target string

## Actual Behaviour

- **split** & **tokens** commands seem to ""tokenize"" as expected, but then leave delimiter and sometimes junk chars on the end of the tokens
- **index** command returns the negative of correct index if search string was found

Two examples of wrong results:  
(tok[3] should be **3456789**)
```
// tok[3]    >>3456789 <<   should NOT include trailing spaces or junk chars
// length (st) : 8
// index of space (st) : -7   << must NOT be less than -1
// st   >>3456789<<
// length (st) : 7
```
and  (tok[7] should be **012**)
```
// tok[7]    >>012^yU<<   should NOT include trailing spaces or junk chars
// length (st) : 6
// index of space (st) : -1   << must NOT be less than -1
// st   >>012^yU<<

In my thinking, the latter no longer make sense. Graphviz’ release cadence is not fixed, not tied to particular features, and currently happens about once a month. The release packages are no more or less stable than the development packages. The development versions have cryptic version numbers, in fact _two_ cryptic version numbers, one for the package registry³ and one reported by the compiled binary. The former number is useless. The latter are occasionally quoted in issues⁴ requiring whoever investigates the issue to first reverse this to a commit hash. The existence of development packages also suggests to downstream ecosystems that they should potentially consume these.⁵

I think we should stop packaging the development versions altogether. If you need access to an inter-release Graphviz, build from source. If there are users who cannot do this but require more frequent Graphviz updates, we should shrink the release cadence.

However it looks like we can configure the cache location, https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/usage/change-cache. And Gitlab also describes what is necessary to cache directories, https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#cache.

Something surprising I discovered is that `artifacts` that are not found at runtime are silently ignored. E.g. The `macos-cmake-build` job inherits from the `macos_build_definition` template that claims to export `GRAPHVIZ_VERSION`. But the CMake build does not produce this file, so sure enough if you check the [build log for a recent run of this job](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/jobs/1732395148), you see:

```
WARNING: GRAPHVIZ_VERSION: no matching files 
```

This seems intentional and not strictly a problem. But a side effect of this is that it is impossible to tell where artifacts are coming from and/or being used from .gitlab-ci.yml alone.

I think we need to get more precise about this and, in particular, make `GRAPHVIZ_VERSION` originate from a single location (the `portable-source` job). As I've mentioned previously, it's not clear to me why the macOS jobs contain comments that they cannot consume `portable-source`.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-10-30 00:04:15.332-04","2022-04-09 00:08:46.541-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

I am repeating a layout of this file:
[Causal_Loop.dot](/uploads/cb28674dc77438ebd5fd7911977b7ad5/Causal_Loop.dot)

## Expected Behaviour

Repeated layouting without an issue.

## Actual Behaviour

The second time I get a memory issue in routespl.c in common library. 
![image](/uploads/44f2e3c7e6364d663e5bc3742e1c701e/image.png)

## OS Version

macOS

## Graphviz Version

run $ dot -V

## Additional info

I use graphviz as a library. That is a contributing factor. 
The problem at hand happens not during first layouting but during second. 
That makes sense as the cycles pointer is static.
![image](/uploads/1536a9f679b2e4aa22f72638db3d756c/image.png)

Interestingly, `cycles` is a vector of vector of nodes, but the `vec_delete` seems to be infinitely recursive, always expecting that the memory references another vector. That is unproblematic for the DFS vectors, as they all emptied before memory deallocation (all nodes are pushed/popped during DFS). But for the resulting vector this is an issue as the result has cycles, so we have indeed a vector of a vector of nodes, and `vec_delete` called on a node has undefined behaviour.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2021-12-12 00:07:25.471-05","2022-01-16 00:05:01.331-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"
2163,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2163","broken RPATHs","`rpmbuild` acquired a new trick in Fedora 35 to detect `RPATH` problems, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Broken_RPATH_will_fail_rpmbuild. When attempting to add Fedora 35 jobs to Graphviz CI, these checks fail the build (log snippet below). It looks like we could set the `QA_RPATHS` mask to `0x0001` to suppress these warnings, but it seems like this is something we should probably fix.

`digraph { A [label="""", style=""rounded"", shape=box] }`

Generated SVG:

![box.svg](/uploads/cc1bdcd3dae5a4fcb99606c1f87bc48f/box.svg)

Expected SVG:

![box-correct.svg](/uploads/a36d74d51304c0b45c2f348df0910edd/box-correct.svg)

It looks the same, but it's not, while looking inside.
Box itself in the generated SVG:

```
<path fill=""none"" stroke=""black"" d=""M42,-36C42,-36 12,-36 12,-36 6,-36 0,-30 0,-24 0,-24 0,-12 0,-12 0,-6 6,0 12,0 12,0 42,0 42,0 48,0 54,-6 54,-12 54,-12 54,-24 54,-24 54,-30 48,-36 42,-36""/>
```

Box in the second SVG:
```
<rect fill=""none"" stroke=""black"" x=""0"" y=""-36"" width=""54"" height=""36"" rx=""12"" ry=""12""/>
```

It seems graphviz doesn't use all language tools provided by the SVG.
The second (suggested) output has the following advantages:


1. This is more compact and need less space in file.
2. This is more clear while looking into SVG file in text editor. SVG is a text format, so this is situation is possible. At that, these files can be stored in git and other VCS with subsequent viewing of changes diff. In this case diff of the latter string is understandable, while in first is not so clear.
3. This should improve SVG editing with vector graphic editors. For example, resizing and changing radius of rectangle with rounded corners is not the same, as these operations with set of curves.
4. This is mathematically correct, unlike the current implementation. Bezier curves cannot exactly represent circle sectors.

## additional info

Repeating the build gives fewer errors the second time and succeeds the third time.

The reason for this problem is missing project references.

Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.7.2 was used.

This problem does not manifest itself when building from the CLI using MSBuild. Presumably because MSBuild does not build subprojects in parallel.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-01-06 00:04:13.453-05","2022-01-06 00:06:24.586-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Additional info
Running `dot -c` manually doesn't help.

The reason for this problem is that the plugin code expects MinGW DLLs to have version numbers which they don't.

2179,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2179","spurious ""no hard-coded metrics"" warnings on labels with empty lines","Recently, the GraphViz version I use on some builder for my project was updated, and many of my tests started failing because of some new warning occasionally emitted by `dot`.    The message is `Warning: no hard-coded metrics for 'Lato'`, where `Lato` is an installed TTF font I use.  But the strange part is that the message was not always emitted for all graphs using Lato.  After some investigation, it seems to be triggered by labels containing empty lines.

## Steps to reproduce

```
% cat foo.dot
digraph """" {
  0 -> 1 [fontname=""Lato"",label=<<br/>1>]
}
% dot -Tsvg foo.dot >/dev/null
Warning: no hard-coded metrics for 'Lato'.  Falling back to 'Times' metrics
% cat bar.dot
digraph """" {
  0 -> 1 [fontname=""Lato"",label=< <br/>1>]
}
% dot -Tsvg bar.dot >/dev/null
```

The difference between these two files is only the space in the label.  Adding the space removes the warning.

Also note that if I add `-v`, it appears the font `Lato` is resolved differently depending on whether the label starts with an empty line or not:

```
% dot -v -Tsvg foo.dot >/dev/null 2>foo.stderr
% dot -v -Tsvg bar.dot >/dev/null 2>bar.stderr
% diff foo.stderr bar.stderr 
26,27c26
< Warning: no hard-coded metrics for 'Lato'.  Falling back to 'Times' metrics
< fontname: ""Lato"" resolved to: [internal hard-coded]
---
> fontname: ""Lato"" resolved to: (PangoCairoFcFont) ""Lato, Regular"" /usr/share/fonts/TTF/Lato-Regular.ttf
```

## Expected Behaviour

I would expect no warning, and the font resolved to `Lato-Regular.ttf` in both cases.

## Expected Behaviour

Nodes *C*, *A*, *F*, and *G* form a vertical line with node *B* to the left. This layout opmises the lengths of the *CA* and *EC* edges:

Node *B* is directly over *A*, *F*, and *G*. Node *C* to the left. The lengths of edges *CA* and *EC* are suboptimal:

In the second example however all arrows go from left to right even though the C -> B arrow going from right to left as in the first example would use less space and look neater.

Maybe additional directions should get used, for example TBLR to force TB flow as the primary direction with a secondary LR flow; LRTB would switch the primary and secondary flow directions; and just specifying a primary flow direction would try and centre the flow around the secondary direction as the first example does.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-01-21 00:08:33.162-05",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

I'm using dot graphs as one part of our software documentation. For that I have version controlled the dot files with git.

As part of viewing differences of dot files, I would like to minimize the diff between each edit. And therefore I'm trying to standardize the graphs. I'm using `canon` as I think that this gives a canonical output format. Unfortunately it takes always a few calls until it generates no changes anymore. Is that to be expected?

```c
#define NOTUSED(x)    (void) (x)
```

This is wrapping the common idiom for squashing warnings for unused parameters. However, it is used inconsistently in the code base. Thus Graphviz developers still need to know and recognize this idiom when they see it.

Should we remove these macros and write `(void)x;` wherever we are ignoring `x`? My thinking is that only two end states make sense: (1) `NOTUSED` used everywhere, or (2) `NOTUSED` used nowhere and removed. Which should we move towards?

CC @magjac, @makelinux

----

Some elaborating discussion for completeness...

There is a GCC extension for squashing such warnings:

```c
void foo(int x __attribute__((unused))) {
}
```

This GNU attribute is also supported by Clang. In C++, there is a much nicer portable way of expressing this by omitting the parameter name:

```cpp
void foo(int) {
}
```

There has been some discussion over the years of bringing attribute syntax to ISO C. C++11 introduced `[[...]]` syntax for attributes and I have some hope this will come to a future version of ISO C. However I am not aware of any plans for this right now.

So a void cast is the most portable way I'm currently aware of for suppressing such warnings in C.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-02-19 00:08:38.032-05","2022-02-20 00:06:15.577-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Tests are currently orchestrated via Pytest. Within this menagerie, rtest/rtest.py is a former Python (or even Perl?) script that has been dragged into the Pytest world against its will. As a result it is not particularly Pythonic and its failures are reported quite cryptically:

```
Test foo:bar : == Failed == baz.png
```

""OK, cool, but what were the differences between the actual output and the reference output?""

My (partially uninformed) summary of what is happening here is that rtest.py was once expected to be run locally. Hence why it outputs minimal information and instead dumps an informative diff as an HTML page for you to load. Of course this HTML page is inaccessible when it is generated in the CI environment. The CI environment is now the main way Graphviz developers execute the test suite. That is, the ground has shifted underneath rtest.py making its assumptions/expectations no longer accurate.

This issue is a proposal to port/rewrite rtest.py (or more accurately, rtest/tests.txt) into Pytest. This should allow (1) more detailed failure feedback, (2) more fine-grained test case failures, and (3) the ability to run rtest.py test cases in parallel. Note that this will require undoing some assumptions, e.g. that `os.getpid()` is a valid way to construct a temporary filename.

2199,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2199","Add a CONTRIBUTING.md to Graphviz","I think Graphviz needs more contributors to be a sustainable project. I propose we should therefore prioritise onboarding of new contributors, by making it clear and transparent how to contribute.

There's emerging standard of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that goes over how to contribute, how the project accepts and reviews changes, expectations around testing and commit messages, and perhaps even what we're looking for help with.

We already have `DEVELOPERS.md` which is mainly aimed at established contributors. I was thinking of something more aimed at newbies.

Some materials for how to set one up:
- https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/
- https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors
- https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/12/11/get-others-involved-in-your-project-with-a-contributing-guide/

While looking at something else in this area, I noticed that neither the CMake support for these sanitizers nor .gitlab-ci.yml uses `-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined`. Without this, UBSan warnings display an error but do not abort program execution.

Maybe the above was already known but it was a surprise to me. Enabling `-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined` reveals that the #1906 test case triggers an integer overflow:

2202,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2202","remove error prone release return-to-development-series step","The current release procedure I follow, as documented in DEVELOPERS.md, is something like this:
1. Create a new branch making CHANGELOG.md changes for the release
2. Wait for CI to pass
3. Merge the branch
4. Wait for deployment to pass on the main branch
5. Create a new branch making CHANGELOG.md changes returning to the development series
6. Wait for CI to pass
7. Merge the branch

These steps are not all serially dependent. In particular, I usually do 4 and 5 in parallel. So the dependency graph looks something like this:

```dot
digraph {
  1 -> 2;
  2 -> 3;
  3 -> 4;
  4 -> 7;
  3 -> 5;
  5 -> 6;
  6 -> 7;

Exercise for the reader: can you spot the problem with the above?

----

If you said either of the following, points to you.
1. Deployment (4) can fail, leaving you in an awkward state
2. Someone else can merge a change in-between (3) and (7)

With respect to the first of these, if there's a transient failure you can retry the deployment job. If there's a more permanent failure, you can revert the release changes and no-harm-no-foul. The commit history looks a bit weird, but the failed release was never exposed to users and the git release tag was never created.

But the second problem is more thorny. If someone merges a change in-between, it will generally pass CI and also get deployed, believing itself to be the authoritative release. So now we have two Graphviz commits each believing they are the same release. ""Ah, but the second cannot succeed because git release tag creation will fail,"" you say. Well, yes. Except that depending on the timing of the intermediate merge, the two deployment tasks can end up racing each other. So you get one of these two commits succeeding but it is unpredictable which one. We have not encountered this scenario yet, so I'm also unsure if Gitlab's `release-cli` tool anticipates this kind of concurrency and it's possible both succeed or fail.

In short, this kind of situation is a foot gun waiting to go off. The only way we avoid it right now is by all maintainers (hopefully) noticing one of the other maintainers is mid-release work flow and pausing what they're doing.

I don't have an answer of how to solve this, but we should try to make this less error prone in future.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-02-26 00:04:18.266-05","2022-08-22 00:09:45.977-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

```

C:\GitLab-Runner\builds\graphviz\graphviz\lib\common\utils.c(361,13): warning C4013: 'access' undefined; assuming extern returning int [C:\GitLab-Runner\builds\graphviz\graphviz\build\lib\common\common_obj.vcxproj]
```

Backtracking what is going on here, it seems most uses of unistd.h functions in the code base have something like the following stanza:

```c
#ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H
#include <unistd.h>
#else
#include <ast/compat_unistd.h>
#endif
```

This is not present in lib/common code because lib/common does not depend on lib/ast. Instead it just does nothing (yolo) if `HAVE_UNISTD_H` prevents the inclusion of unistd.h.

So two relevant things to note:
1. unistd.h “shimming” like this is still an ongoing concern, AFAIK. Windows remains a hold out, that refuses to ship unistd.h.
2. lib/ast, (that I've heard variously referred to as “Abstract Software Toolkit” or “Advanced Software Technology” or “AT&T Software Technology”) is not the base of the dependency tree.

Should we move the unistd.h abstraction to cgraph or somewhere else? Should we try to purge platform-specific usage of such functions? Should we just shim unistd.h in windows/include/config.h that's hard coded anyway?",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-03-02 00:08:06.887-05","2022-04-24 00:02:41.583-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

2212,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2212","Licensing - commercial plugins","Dear Sir or Madam,

I am considering building a custom layout engine plugin, that I may or may not (partially) commercialize at a later date.
As far as I can see, you are currently using the [EPL v1.0](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/main/LICENSE), which means that the question ""_Do I need to disclose my source code or not_"" would basically boil down to: is the plugin a derivative work or not.

With regards to that topic, I find the following on the eclipse [EPL FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php):
> 27. **I'm a programmer not a lawyer, can you give me a clear cut example of when something is or is not a derivative work?**
>
> [...]
>
>  For clarity, merely interfacing or interoperating with Eclipse Platform Plug-in APIs (without modification) does not make an Eclipse Platform Plug-in a derivative work.

Before I would undertake such a massive endeavor, I would like to have some clarity from your end on this matter.

Since the above statement is 
1) from the Eclipse Foundation and not from the GraphViz team
2) not part of the license itself

I think I cannot assume that your stance is similar towards the creation of ""plugins"", although I believe it is within the intended purpose of the EPL to allow such a thing.

So therefore, my question is as following:

> Would you consider a custom layout engine a derivative work if it
> 1) Is based on a completely unmodified copy of GraphViz
> 2) Where the unmodified copy of GraphViz is used _only_ as a linking target, i.e.
>    - My plugin dynamically registers itself via the `gvc` functionalities
>    - In order to do so uses the functionalities as defined in `gvplugin_layout.h` (and possibly `gvplugin_render.h` and/or `gvplugin_textlayout.h`)
>    - As a consequence also uses all transitive data types associated with the aforementioned, for instance:  \
>      `graph_t` -> `Agraph_s` -> `Agobj_t`, `Agdesc_t`, `Dtlink_t`,... => ...
>    - Calls the regular GraphViz API's, e.g. `gvContext`, `gvParseArgs`, `agopen`, `gvRenderJobs`... to create graphs dynamically
>    - All of the above *only* through dynamic linking, i.e. no changes to the original work.

Thank you in advance for considering my question.

Kind regards,

This version renders correctly instead, it is like a virtual edge is created inside the cluster at some point.
I'm not sure if it is intended behavior, I found it surprising.

First priority: Allow adding `alt` text for an entire Graph, when the Graph is output to SVG format. I think this will give us the most value, by allowing people to summarise entire graphs for visually impaired readers.

Second priority: Allow adding `alt` text for [image nodes](https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/image/) like you can on the web.

For example, we could add a Graphviz attribute like `alt` or `desc` that outputs a `<description>` tag for SVG output.

Graphviz's attribute would probably want to abstract over various output formats. SVG is probably most important, followed by PDF, then (probably far down the list) HTML image maps (we have an old bug filed about image map alt text: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/265).

Prior art:

HTML:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/longDesc (deprecated)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption

SVG:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title (accessible, short-text description)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc (accessible, long-text description)

We may want to, like SVG, allow specifying a long and short variant. Although it's not clear how other formats would support that.

Let’s start with letting the end user specify the alt text. I think auto-generating alt text will be too hard and end up being too verbose for screen readers, but we could explore that later.

The `alt`, `desc`, `longdesc`, and `title` attributes all seem as-yet unused in Graphviz: https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html.

I'd be interested in feedback on this plan. Maybe I'm being too ambitious trying to have this abstract across formats, for example.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-04-02 00:08:08.572-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

2231,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2231","Facilitate creation of legends for graphs","A challenges many GraphViz users face is the desire to add a legend, which clarifies the choices of colors, shapes, fonts etc. for different categories of nodes (and edges) in the graph.

See, for example, [this popular StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3499056/1593077https://stackoverflow.com/q/3499056/1593077) about the matter, accessed 38,000 times.

I am not a GraphViz expert, so I can't quite tell whether, using GraphViz' existing facilities, one can easily create and place a legend.

So, I am asking for one of two action items:

1. Add a section to the documentation explaining how to create and place reasonable-looking legends for graphs.
2. Add specific facilities which would help with legends, e.g. perhaps for subgraph positioning, subgraph scaling, spacing within subgraphs etc. (those are just off-the-cuff ideas).",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-04-12 00:00:33.882-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

Install qt6. Then run the conventional autotools build with autogen.sh, configure, make

## Expected Behaviour

builds gvedit.app

## Actual Behaviour

First requires small changes to configure.ac, cmd/gvedit/imageviewer.cpp mainly, also gvedit/Makefile. Then gvedit.app builds without much drama.

## OS Version

MacOS 12.3.1 Monterey

## Graphviz Version

3.0.1 dev 

## Additional info

With some fixing, gvedit builds and seemingly works with QT6. In gvedit, we don't need to specify UTF-8 encoding in mdichild.cpp any more for QT6 - it is apparently the default. There were a few lines of fluff required in imageviewer.cpp to get QWidget resizing to compile again. QT6 doesn't have pkgconfig, so for testing, I commented out the tests in the top configure.ac, but it needs to be re-enabled.  gvedit/Makefile needed help to include -framework QWidgets and to know the location of QPrinter and QMainWindow for C++ - I am at a loss to explain why these are not linked by Homebrew to an easily discovered place.  That's about it.

It might be possible to avoid code changes using a qt5 shim for qt6, but is that a good idea?  That doesn't seem like it would help with the other problems. 

Is it better to have ifdefs for QT5 and QT6, or just cut over to QT6?

Someone needs to investigate QT6 licensing questions.

1. The CMake build fails due to compiler warnings in the Lasi plugin.
2. The Autotools build can't find OCaml headers, which fails packaging.

The first:

```

```

is relatively easy to solve. We need to do some more work like 89edf3fe0ac0378b7d1297a0ca349a15bade3980.

But the second:

## Expected Behaviour

The grammar specifies that the rule `edgeRHS` accepts either a `node_id` or a `subgraph`, and `subgraph` is defined as [ **subgraph** [ _ID_ ] ] '**{**' _stmt_list_ '**}**', i.e. subgraphs in EdgeRHS can either be specified with (i) curly brackets only; (ii) **subgraph** followed by brackets; and (iii) **subgraph** followed by an identifier, followed by curly brackets.

The example provided in the _Steps to reproduce_ present a simple example of (i), then (iii), then (ii). All are correct w.r.t. to the grammar and should be accepted by dotty.

## Actual Behaviour

(i) and (iii) works as expected, but (ii) fails with:

Then swap splines = false to splines = true to see the difference

Or render using graphviz #graphviz.render('neato', 'png', 'filename').replace('\\', '/')

## Expected Behaviour

When using splines = true I would expect the edges to go around the nodes but without merging the multi-edges between some of the nodes

## Actual Behaviour

When using splines = true, parallel edges (multi-edges) get merged and I loose some of my edges.

## Additional info

As seen in this stackoverflow post parallel edges used to be rendered differently:
[The stackoverflow link in question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16173764/what-is-the-best-way-to-draw-large-graph-using-graphvis?rq=1)
Testing the code in that link the edges dont render like they do now, so this is probably a bug introduced in later updates.

[_demo_3x.gv](/uploads/aae698f48936c337c964838c1a989b60/_demo_3x.gv)

I use `dot -Tpng ` to generate png the .gv file. Also tried as .pdf and .svg. No luck.
I've been searching and trying to figure out the logic behind the output but it seems it's just random. 

![image](/uploads/af06c67b132bb383b9dd7c7a567c49f2/image.png)

I want to order the subgraphs in the order of the labels 1 2 3 4 5 6, top to bottom and aligned. 
Also, tried to add invis edge between consecutive subgraphs like 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3 but again the result wasn't deterministic.

## Expected Behaviour

I'm expecting to get the same output everytime I render the same .gv file.

## Actual Behaviour

I get different layout everytime I generate the graph.

The following input.dot file:

```
digraph {
  node [shape=cylinder] # Make all nodes have 'cylinder' shape

    0 [orientation=0]
   45 [orientation=45]
   90 [orientation=90]
  135 [orientation=135]
  180 [orientation=180]
  225 [orientation=225]

  315 [orientation=315]
  0 -> 45 -> 90 -> 135 -> 180 -> 225 -> 270 -> 315 -> 0
}
```

And then run `dot -Tpng input.dot -o output.png`

## Expected Behaviour

I expect to see an image such as in the documentation for orientation (https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/orientation/), but with rotated cylinders instead of houses.

## Actual Behaviour

Instead, the cylinders aren't rotated and the image looks like ![this](/uploads/747ca99ce5d03a41c0b97ceecd34e10e/output.png), with none of the cylinders rotated.

2245,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2245","pdf driver: Support splitting big graphs on multiple pages for printing","We use the Gramps Genealogy Software in order to manage family histories. One of the features of that program is to let graphviz render a big family tree.
I have received a couple of requests from people I introduced to the software to be actually able to print out the graphs they generated. Since the graphs are too big most of the time to be readable when printed on a single page, it would be desirable to let the graph spawn multiple A3 / A4 pages as those are the formats they are able to print with their home printers.

According to https://graphviz.org/faq/#FaqMultiPage such a feature exists in graphviz with the postscript driver and in terms of splitting the graph it actually works, however it is not really useful for us, since we are based in Europe where ancestors spawn multiple countries and we can't really get around utf8 encoding.

## Steps to reproduce

First graph was produced via

```
dot -Gpage=""8,11"" -Gsize=""160,10"" -Tps2 test.gv > test.ps
```

and second graph via

```
dot -Gpage=""8,11"" -Gsize=""160,10"" -Tpdf test.gv > test.pdf
```

## Expected Behaviour

The ""page"" setting should be honored by the pdf drivers, similarly to postscript. 

## Actual Behaviour

The graph produced with the postscript driver is split accross multiple pages, while the graph produced with the pdf driver is not.
Furthermore the font rendering of the post script graph looks bad compared to the pdf one and utf8 does not work.

To give a brief impression, we have graphviz files containing labels like

```
label=""Fornadi, Anna Balmt\n(1736 – 1791-01-05)\n( – Ötteveny, Sterbe.b.Bild 49)\n(third great grandmother)""
```

which is rendered in the following way in case of postscript:

![image](/uploads/cd74ecca34f55ea71a8d3b407635f214/image.png)

while in the pdf output it looks like

## OS Version

Windows 10 / Ubuntu 21.10

## Graphviz Version

graphviz version 2.43.0 (0)

## Additional notes

It would additionally be great if borders of pages could be honored by the page setting, as some printers can't print border-less and when scaling down the page, scaling might be inconsistent such that the multiple pages do not perfectly fit together in the end.

**Ideally additional constraints could be introduced at the graph building stage, such that no nodes are split between multiple pages, but only the connection lines.**",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-06-03 00:04:01.014-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

It's kind of a long story, and I know for a fact this is one of those things that might not happen for years and then suddenly happen, and one would have no idea why.  However I tracked down the reason, and that reason in the end is straightforward and straightforward to fix.  Hence the fix might be uncontroversial for you: I'm just trying to ""give back"" a little by reporting it.

When it does happen, it's from

$ dot -c

or

$ dot -c -v

## Expected Behaviour

`dot -c`: I expect it to generate a `config6` file (and silently exit with 0 exit code).
`dot -c -v`: Similar but it should print ""libdir = <...>"" where <...> is a real absolute path with some libs; and lots of info about plugins it's configuring, or something like that.

## Actual Behaviour

`dot -c`: It is silent and generates exit code 0, but it does not produce config6 file.
`dot -c -v`: It prints ""libdir = <something weird, a fragment of what it should be, a relative path, possibly mangled>""; and no plugins it configured.

## Additional info

The actual bug is here:

```
  327             FILE* f = fopen (""/proc/self/maps"", ""r"");

  333                     if (!strstr (line, "" r-xp ""))
  334                         continue;

  341                         /* Check for real /lib dir. Don't accept pre-install /.libs */
  342                         if (strcmp(strrchr(path,'/'), ""/.libs"") == 0)
  343                             continue;
  344                         strcpy(line, path);  /* use line buffer for result */
  345                         strcat(line, ""/graphviz"");  /* plugins are in ""graphviz"" subdirectory */
  346                         libdir = line;
  347                         break;
  348                     }
  349                 }
  350                 fclose (f);
  351             }
```

Note this: `strcpy(line, path);  /* use line buffer for result */` It is copying `path` (which by that point is a postfix of `line`) to the start of `line`. But strcpy() docs explicitly disallow the dest and src strings overlapping.  Sometimes it works: sometimes, apparently, it does not.

Some examples of where I've seen it fail:

```
before strcpy():
7fc476058000-7fc4760e3000 r-xp 00000000 103:0b 37749392                  /home/ygoldfel/dev/git/ipc/3-ipc/akamai/graphviz/export/usr/local/akamai/graphviz/lib/libgvc.

supposed to be after strcpy():
/home/ygoldfel/dev/git/ipc/3-ipc/akamai/graphviz/export/usr/local/akamai/graphviz/lib/ 

actually ends up being:
graphviz/lib
```

One way to fix it (verified it fixed it):

                        /* Use memmove(), since they overlap. */
                        memmove(line, path, strlen(path) + 1); /* use line buffer for result */

2254,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2254","Missing layout functions via libgvc in external package","In the `pygraphviz` project we are working on packaging up binary wheels to make installing much easier for Python users - see https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/pull/421.

We have had good success so far getting the appropriate graphviz libraries, namely `libgvc`, `libcgraph`, and `libcdt`, incorporated into the wheel (at least for Linux) and I am fairly confident that all of the linking and runtime library loading is being handled correctly. However, when it comes to actually *using* the layout functions via `libgvc`, I am noticing that the list of available layouts for the platform is empty. Here is a quick example:

```python
>>> import pygraphviz as pgv
>>> A = pgv.AGraph()
>>> A.add_path([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> A.layout(prog=""neato"")
Error: Layout type: ""neato"" not recognized. Use one of:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/root/pgv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pygraphviz/agraph.py"", line 1494, in layout
    raise ValueError(f""Program {prog} is not a valid layout program."")
ValueError: Program b'neato' is not a valid layout program.
```

Note that the Traceback originates from `pygraphviz`, but the `Error:` statement prior originates from graphviz itself, specifically here:

https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/main/lib/gvc/gvc.c#L51-61

From the `agerr` message, it is clear that the `gvplugin_list(gvc, API_layout, engine)` is empty, i.e. there are no recognized layout plugins installed. I was initially very confused by this because from the graphviz configuration, it seems that at least some of the layout functions should always be available. Here is the output from `./configure` for the build that gave the above results:

```
plugin libraries:
  dot_layout:    Yes (always enabled)
  neato_layout:  Yes (always enabled)
  core:          Yes (always enabled)
  devil:         No (missing library)
  gd:            No (gd headers not found)
  gdiplus:       No (disabled by default - Windows only)
  gdk:           
  gdk_pixbuf:    No (gdk_pixbuf library not available)
  ghostscript:   No (missing headers)
  glitz:         No (disabled by default - incomplete)
  gtk:           No (gtk library not available)
  lasi:          No (missing pangocairo support)
  pangocairo:    No (pangocairo library not available)
  poppler:       No (poppler library not available)
  quartz:        No (disabled by default - Mac only)
  rsvg:          No (rsvg library not available)
  visio:         Yes
  webp:          No (webp library not available)
  xlib:          Yes
```

So it doesn't seem to be a graphviz build problem. My next thought was that the plugin libraries (e.g. `gvplugin_neato_layout`) were not being packaged/discovered correctly in the wheel, but fixing that problem (see https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/pull/421/commits/a9277e99bb0d94d24de351d07bdab379cf19d60e) yielded the same results - an empty layout list.

After reading through the graphviz source code and [related issues](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1642) more closely, I now suspect that the problem is related to a missing configuration/layout registration step. For example, [the addingLayouts.txt](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/main/doc/addingLayout.txt) doc references running `dot -c` to generate a `config6` file, which presumably is used for layout discovery. I have spent some time in the code trying to tease out specifically how/where this config is loaded/used, but haven't quite grokked it yet. Given the current state of my investigations, I figured it might be worthwhile ping you all to see if I'm on the right track. So, to any `libgvc` experts:
 - Does my assumption that the missing link here is the layout configuration seem likely? And if so:
 - Is there a recommended best-practice for generating/loading the configuration programatically? For our purposes it would be best if we could generate a `config6` file during the build, distribute it with the package, and modify/configure `libgvc` to know where to look for the configuration within the package.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-06-24 00:00:07.811-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

2257,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2257","remove GV_FILE_PATH?","Graphviz contains a mechanism for restricting what files can be read via the environment variable `$GV_FILE_PATH`. This is used when running in a CGI-based webserver environment when the variable `$SERVER_NAME` is set.

While this was probably quite useful previously, the web has moved on considerably since the days when CGI was in vogue. To sandbox web-reachable tools these days, I think the usual practice is to use the file system restriction mechanisms built into your webserver itself (Nginx, Apache, etc.). These are both more well tested and more reliable than asking a tool to sandbox itself.

I suggest we deprecate and remove these mechanisms within Graphviz and point users elsewhere.

If we were to retain a Graphviz-specific sandbox, I would recommend it be a standalone tool using operating system recommended sandboxing mechanisms (e.g. Seccomp). It's much easier to audit the code of a small sandboxer utility than to audit the entirety of Graphviz for security bypasses (many of which we know exist). Though my first preference is to provide no sandboxing at all, as even desktop operating systems are finally beginning to gain their own native sandboxes for running truly untrusted binaries (Bubblewrap, App Sandbox, Firejail, ...).",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-07-08 00:04:21.241-04","2022-08-20 00:08:26.084-04","[]","[]","[]","[]"

## Expected Behaviour

I believe the attribute id = ""G2"" should affect all id:s

## Actual Behaviour

""G2"" is included in id:s for graph, nodes etc. but not in linearGradients. That messes up the gradient fill when more than one graph svg is included on a web page.

Windows 11

Essentially the LibGD plugin provides exactly the behavior I want, where the font can be specified by an actual path to a TTF file.  On Linux and macOS builds of graphviz, the libgd plugin is normally included and with a hack can override the default graphviz config file to ensure LibGD used for textlayout.  (More difficult because graphviz doesn't allow spaces in plugin paths.)  Unfortunately, the default Windows builds of graphviz exclude libgd so that isn't an option.

----

While we're on this topic, the way the headers are setup is going to require workarounds and hacks forever. None of this is related to the C++ libs, and obviously hindsight is 20/20, and perhaps the “sane” way of managing headers only emerged after Graphviz’ birth. But let me outline my template for a CMake project that avoids all of this:

```
├ CMakeLists.txt
├ mybin/
│  ├ CMakeLists.txt
│  └ src/
│     └ main.c
└ libfoo/
   ├ CMakeLists.txt
   ├ include/
   │  └ foo/
   |     ├ foo.h
   │     ├ other_header_a.h
   │     └ other_header_b.h
   └ src/
      └ some_source.c
```

The top-level CMakeLists.txt does no include path fiddling. It simply does:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(mybin)
add_subdirectory(libfoo)
```

mybin/CMakeLists.txt also does no include path fiddling. It simply does:

```cmake
add_executable(mybin src/main.c)
target_link_libraries(mybin PRIVATE libfoo) # ← all include stuff dealt with by this line
```

libfoo/CMakeLists.txt is where include paths are set:

```cmake
add_library(libfoo src/some_source.c)
target_include_directories(libfoo
  PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
)

# make sure library output is called “libfoo” and not “liblibfoo”
set_target_properties(libfoo PROPERTIES PREFIX """")
```

Now you write code inside libfoo that uses `<>` paths:

```c
// libfoo/src/some_source.c

#include <foo/other_header_a.h>
```

Code in mybin is written as if it were a third-party external consumer, just like anyone else. But the only thing it should include is the all-encompassing API header:

```c
// mybin/src/main.c

#include <foo/foo.h>
```

This work because foo.h’s entire contents are:

```c
#pragma once

#include <foo/other_header_a.h>
#include <foo/other_header_b.h>
```

Note how (1) all C code accesses libfoo’s headers uniformly, regardless of where it lives (within libfoo, in mybin, or out-of-tree) and (2) libfoo is an actual non-porous abstraction in CMake (mybin knows nothing of libfoo’s internal structure and this structure can be rearranged at will without needing to update mybin). I omitted some details, but you can see a full real world embodiment of this in https://github.com/Smattr/vimcat.

I don't have any answers to how we get to the above, or if this is even desirable given other trade offs. But I just wanted to spell this out in case it gave anyone else ideas.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-09-07 00:03:30.388-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

networkx for instance allows in their both Fruchterman-Reingold and Kamada-Kawai algorithms to input a dictionary of positions that one can define seperately. This has a usecase in a problem I am exploring as well as multilayered algorithms that many researchers define.

## Expected Behaviour

The `margin=0` of cluster_0 of the first graph takes effect.

## Actual Behaviour

The only difference between the first graph and the second graph is that the label is directly placed in the node `d`, so the `margin=0` of the second graph takes effect, but the horizontal node-edge length of the first graph in `cluster_0` is obviously sufficient. But an additional `margin` is generated to be compatible with the label.

## OS Version

CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)

## Graphviz Version

dot - graphviz version 5.0.0 (20220707.1540)

## Additional info

I guess that when graphviz generates a horizontal layout, it will reverse the height and width in a vertical layout, and then implement a horizontal layout by rotating the coordinates of the elements in the graph.<br/><br/>
However, it is more difficult to deal with the label of the `cluster`, because the label of the `cluster` is placed on the left and right sides of the `cluster` before being `rotated`, which brings a problem. The label of the cluster may stretch the vertical distance between ranks. and margin size.<br/><br/>
Graphviz adopts the principle of greed. The cluster that is calculated first will give priority to the vertical distance between ranks or the size of the margin. Different execution orders may make the margin sometimes take effect and sometimes not take effect.<br/><br/>
In the first graph above, `cluster_0` is calculated first. At this time, it is found that the total length of the rank from `a0` to `a3` is not enough to fully contain the content of the label, and the left and right margins of `cluster_0` and `rank[2,3]` and `rank[6, 7]` the distance between.<br/><br/>
Then start to calculate the label length of `cluster_4` at this time, and find that the two ranks before and after `d` are not long enough, and choose to stretch the distance between the left and right margins of `cluster_4` and `rank[3,4]` and `rank[4,5]`. <br/><br/>
After the completion of `cluster_4`, the distance between the first rank of `cluster_0` and the last rank is enough to accommodate the label of `cluster_0`, resulting in the above result.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-09-13 00:03:46.921-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

### Autotools

2285,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2285","Add SVG output suitable for inlining in HTML","Offer a new output format `svg:tag` or `inline_svg` or `svg_inline` or `svg_html`, or maybe even `xhtml`. Naming bikeshed comments welcome, I think it's important that this has a good name.

This should output a `<svg>...</svg>` tree suitable for inline inclusion in an HTML5 document, i.e.:

```
$ echo 'digraph {}' | dot -Tinline_svg
<svg width=""8pt"" height=""8pt""
 viewBox=""0.00 0.00 8.00 8.00"">
<g id=""graph0"" class=""graph"" transform=""scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 4)"">
<polygon fill=""white"" stroke=""none"" points=""-4,4 -4,-4 4,-4 4,4 -4,4""/>
</g>
</svg>
```

Extra points if it's suitable for inclusion in an XHTML document too, though I don't think XHTML is very popular these days. I'm not sure if the `xmlns` attributes are required for inclusion in XHTML? If so, this should be a separate output format.

This would particularly be helpful for the Graphviz docs, and in other technical docs. I'd love to 'scratch my own itch' here.

## Background

Sometimes, I like to embed Graphviz generations into websites.

There aren't many great options for this.

- `<img>` tags don't let you click on HREFs, can't select text
- `<iframe>`s are heavyweight, are harder to use javascript cross-page, and don't set their height automatically, and links open in the iframe. We use these a lot in technical docs, but it requires setting `target=_parent` on every `href` in the graph.
- `<object>` tags are kinda obsolete.
- there are some other funny ways, but they're all silly: https://vecta.io/blog/best-way-to-embed-svg

Inlining an `<svg>` tag directly into the HTML is very nice, and makes hrefs open in the same frame, lets javascript access the nodes, sets correct height. It's a great option!

But it's hard to use in Graphviz's output today. If you try to output SVG, you get output unsuitable for inline SVG, with `<?xml>`, `<!DOCTYPE>` tags and `xmlns` attributes that you have to remove to inline:

```
$ echo 'digraph {}' | dot -Tsvg
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN""
 ""http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd"">
<!-- Generated by graphviz version 5.0.1 (20220820.1526)
 -->
<!-- Pages: 1 -->
<svg width=""8pt"" height=""8pt""
 viewBox=""0.00 0.00 8.00 8.00"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">
<g id=""graph0"" class=""graph"" transform=""scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 4)"">
<polygon fill=""white"" stroke=""none"" points=""-4,4 -4,-4 4,-4 4,4 -4,4""/>
</g>
</svg>
```

## Demand for this feature

This ends up with fairly silly workarounds, like:
- this jekyll-graphviz plugin that parses the XML to remove the `<?xml>`, `<!DOCTYPE>` tags and `xmlns` attributes: https://github.com/kui/jekyll-graphviz/blob/master/lib/jekyll/graphviz/renderer.rb#L46-L56
- another jekyll diagram plugin, that regexes out the `<?xml>`: https://github.com/zhustec/jekyll-diagrams/blob/master/lib/jekyll-diagrams/graphviz/renderer.rb#L21
- @magjac's own Graphviz Visual Editor parses the SVG, to grab the document element from inside it (probably the cleanest option I've seen out there, full credit to Magnus): https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz/blob/4cc0267fdc721c579c0457ca745d5a15fc93fb85/src/dot.js#L323
- This blogpost mentions stripping off the `<?xml>` tag and `<!doctype>` with some brittle array indexing: https://hokstad.com/inline-graphviz#:~:text=strip%20off%20the%20XML%20declaration%20and%20DOCTYPE
- This old email mentions stripping the `<!DOCTYPE>` and `<?xml>`: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Mar/0156.html

I think such a feature would remove the need for these workarounds.

## How would we do it?

Hopefully, reuse most of the SVG code, just don't output the header!",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-10-07 00:05:48.945-04",NULL,"[""enhancement""]","[]","[]","[]"

I suspect this is related to the recent move from `dot_builtins.c` to `dot_builtins.cpp`. But I'm not sure how.

`grep` points at the proximate cause in a `.deps` folder (what is that? I'm not familiar with this build system):

```
$ grep ""\\bdot_builtins.c\\b"" -r .
./cmd/dot/.deps/dot_builtins-dot_builtins.Po:dot_builtins-dot_builtins.o: dot_builtins.c ../../config.h \

Expected:
- dot version
- no errors
- if we're using graphviz dynamic libraries, they should be the ones in the local directory that I presumably just built, not ones in `/usr/local/lib`

Actual:

I suspect the first two are empty-strings.

I came across this trying to figure out if I could get the macOS build working with more plugins. I don't actually need the DevIL library.

Coming up with a compliant version of this may take a little thought. The naive version would be:

```c
struct flag {
  unsigned type: 4;
  bool mod_open: 1;
  bool mod_inv: 1;
  bool mod_left: 1;
  bool mod_right: 1;
};

typedef struct arrowdir_t {
  char *dir;
  struct flag sflag[4];
  struct flag eflag[4];
};
```

But `sizeof(struct flag)` above is 4. An alternative is to use a `uint8_t` for `type` that makes the size 1 as desired, but this is non-standard and not necessarily supported by all compilers.

It is not clear to me _why_ these need to be packed into 32 bits, so it's possible the size constraints I'm trying to achieve above are not well motivated.

As a brief preview of the type of simplification this would allow:

```diff
-f = (flag >> (i * BITS_PER_ARROW)) & ((1 << BITS_PER_ARROW_TYPE) - 1);
+f = flag[i].type;
 …
-f = (flag >> (i * BITS_PER_ARROW)) & ((1 << BITS_PER_ARROW) - 1);
+f = flag[i];

## Additional info

I don't actually need an `HREF` on this node, but according to https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1425 (and what I observe), no tooltip is displayed at all unless there's an `HREF`.  So the primary bug here is that tooltips don't display unless there's a link, and the secondary bug is that even when there's a link, they still don't display as intended.

```
... pygraphviz.libs/libgvplugin_core-3e57ffe9.so.6.0.0: undefined symbol: __exp_finite
```

Note that this behavior is observed when building in an environment with glibc-2.17, but installing/running on a system with a newer glibc (2.36).
A quick search turned up others experiencing potential issues with `__*_finite` functions as of glibc-2.31, cf. [here](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/issues/975) and [here](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2020-02/msg00001.html).

As noted in the above linked sources, we were able to work around this issue by disabling `fast-math`, i.e. removing `-ffast-math` from `configure`:

https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/main/configure.ac#L404

One potential solution for our use-case would be to add a flag to the `configure` script (e.g. `--disable-fast-math`); at least then we wouldn't need to modify the script itself prior to building. From the surrounding lines above it looks like fast-math is already disabled for e.g. icc.

## Additional info

This was discovered while trying to fix #372 for the cylinder node shape. The fix uses an invisible extra periphery which got distorted the same way and caused the ""inside"" function to fail.

The reason for the bug is that the cylinder shape is represented by a polygon during layout and this polygon has several consecutive vertices which are the same point which the periphery creation functionality currently cannot handle (This polygon is replaced with cubic Bezier curves during rendering and the ""same""-points are needed as control points to create the straight lines in the cylinder shape).",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-10-13 00:07:32.123-04","2023-02-25 00:02:55.434-05","[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"
2298,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2298","consider dropping ICC support","Something that caught my eye is that Linux 6.1 will be dropping support for compiling the kernel with the Intel C Compiler (ICC), https://lore.kernel.org/linux-acpi/20221011031843.960217-1-masahiroy@kernel.org/. It seems this was silently broken for a long time. It made me wonder if we could drop the ICC workarounds in Graphviz. I suspect our ICC support is silently broken too, as we don't test it.

I knew ICC had migrated to being LLVM-based in recent times. But I had thought this meant using an LLVM middle end and back end, while still maintaining a custom Intel front end.¹ Contrary to this, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/adoption-of-llvm-complete-icx.html implies to me their front end is now Clang. If this is the case, then all our ICC workarounds can be dropped, as we already support (and test on several platforms) Clang.

¹ In C/C++ compiler terminology:
- “front end” – lexer, parser, semantic analysis
- “middle end” – optimization pipeline
- “back end” – target-specific code generation

These definitions are a bit hand wavy, and older compilers like GCC don’t have such a strong distinction between the parts.

{

...
}
...
static grid *update_columns(grid * g, char *str)

This code duplicates `str` (with no error handling, by the way) in order to `strtok` it, stores various pointers to within the duplicate into the grid, and then loses the pointer `buf`. Later code never calls `free` on the `->name` fields, not that this would be correct either.

I don't know if the ""free existing memory if necessary"" comment is meant to be some kind of TODO, indicating the original author was aware of the problem but postponed dealing with it.

Given where we're at now, I would suggest rewriting this to this use lib/cgraph/tokenize.h instead of `strtok`, `gv_strdup`-ing the results into `->name` and then adding a `free` of `->name` into `clearGrid`.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-10-15 00:09:12.1-04","2022-11-10 00:00:40.406-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"

```

Pulling the thread on this, neither of these are false positives. The problem is that `agobjfn_t` takes 3 parameters:

```c
typedef void (*agobjfn_t) (Agraph_t * g, Agobj_t * obj, void *arg);
```

In the `agraphattr_init` case, it only takes a single parameter:

```c
void agraphattr_init(Agraph_t * g)
```

So using it in combination with `agapply` is relying on the calling convention for a 1-parameter function and a 3-parameter function being compatible. While this is true on x86-64 and ARM, it is not true on all platforms.

The `dict_relabel` case is even more curious. `dict_relabel` takes 2 parameters, but where `agraphattr_init` is assuming it can elide the second and third parameter, `dict_relabel` is assuming it can elide the _first_:

```c
static void dict_relabel(Agnode_t * n, void *arg)
```

I do not understand how this would work on any of the major platforms we currently support (x86-64/ARM × BSD/Linux/macOS/Windows). It looks to me like it would only ever work with a purely stack-based calling convention that indexed and pushed/popped the arguments last-to-first. Maybe this was written/tested on 32-bit x86? There, I believe the calling convention would make things work. But in contrast, the `agraphattr_init` case would be busted on 32-bit x86.

Does anyone understand how/why any of this was intended to work? It is a bit mysterious to me.",NULL,NULL,"opened",NULL,"2022-10-16 00:09:44.801-04",NULL,"[]","[]","[]","[]"

2302,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2302","agxbuf structure packing","I've been thinking about refactoring the structure of agxbuf and thought I'd write up some of my thoughts for people to consider.

## Background

`agxbuf` is a Graphviz type for dynamic string construction. You can think of it as the equivalent of C++'s `std::ostringstream`, or even more closely POSIX's `open_memstream`. It can be in two different states, external storage or heap-allocated:

```c
// setting up a buffer with external storage
char backing[10]; // ← backing memory for the buffer
agxbuf external_buf1 = {0};
agxbinit(&buf1, sizeof(backing), backing);

// setting up a buffer with heap-allocation
agxbuf buf2 = {0};
```

When a buffer with external storage is about to overflow, it will switch to heap-allocated. So the caller does not need to think about the bounds of the buffer.

Something I have been thinking about is supporting a third state, inline storage. For small amounts of data, the members of the struct can be repurposed to store the data _itself_. This is a technique known as Small/Short String Optimization¹ (SSO). The advantage of this is that smaller strings (likely the default in Graphviz) need no allocation at all.

A secondary thing I've been thinking about is packing an `agxbuf` itself into fewer bytes. This actually _decreases_ the number of strings eligible for SSO (the available inline space shrinks), but `agxbuf` objects are created frequently, so maybe it's worth shrinking their stack footprint.

So how do we achieve these things? Lets look at some possible changes below. Note that almost all involve moving from a (base pointer, end pointer) pair to a (base pointer, extent) pair because the latter is a bit easier to think about.

## Option 0 – leave as-is

As a point of comparison, the current layout of `agxbuf` is:

```c
/* Extensible buffer:
 *  Malloc'ed memory is never released until agxbfree is called.
 */
typedef struct {
  char *buf;           // start of buffer
  char *ptr;           // next place to write
  char *eptr;          // end of buffer
  int stack_allocated; // false if buffer is malloc'ed
} agxbuf;
```

It's possible the optimizations above and below are not worth it (we should profile some expensive cases). So leaving the struct as-is is a real option.

## Packing the stack/heap bit

```c
typedef struct {
  char *buf;                               // start of buffer
  size_t size;                             // number of bytes used
  size_t capacity: sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 1; // number of bytes available
  bool stack_allocated: 1;                 // false if buffer is malloc'ed
} agxbuf;
```

This shrinks the structure by `sizeof(int)` (4 bytes on x86 and x86-64). We can no longer manage a string with backing memory ≥ 2⁶³ on x86-64 (2³¹ on x86), but it seems unlikely we need such a thing anyway. Note that the upper bit of `.size` is useless because we now cannot increase the backing memory to support a string of this size.

## Introducing SSO

```c
typedef struct {
  char *buf;                               // start of buffer
  size_t size;                             // number of bytes used
  size_t capacity: sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 2; // number of bytes available
  unsigned location: 2;                    // out-of-line, inline, or heap
} agxbuf;
```

We need to enlarge the field used for indicating the location of the backing memory. We now need 2 bits, because we have 3 possibilities. Lets choose the encoding `0b00` = inline, `0b01` = out-of-line, `0b10` = heap. This may seem like an arbitrary choice, but it is not. Using `0b00` for inline allows us to have a naturally NUL terminated buffer. To explain, lets look at a more complete definition:

```c
typedef struct {
  union {
    char raw[sizeof(char*) + sizeof(size_t) + sizeof(size_t)];
    struct {
      char *buf;                               // start of buffer
      size_t size;                             // number of bytes used
      size_t capacity: sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 2; // number of bytes available
      unsigned location: 2;                    // out-of-line, inline, or heap
    };
  };
} agxbuf;
```

The `.raw` member is what we use for the backing memory when the string is inline. But we can't use the last byte because some of its bits are the very data we examine to determine _if_ this string is inline. By choosing `0b00` to mean inline, we can leave the last byte NUL so we have a well-formed string. Note that having a NUL terminator is _required_ when we're storing the string inline, because we no longer have a `.size` member. We need to rely on `strlen` to tell us the size of the string.

## More intelligent packing

We noted that the initial packing lost us a bit from both `.size` and `.capacity`. The SSO expansion of this field to 2 bits lost us a further bit. Can we reclaim this somehow?

```c
typedef struct {
  union {
    char raw[sizeof(char*) + sizeof(size_t) + sizeof(size_t)];
    struct {
      char *buf;                               // start of buffer
      size_t size: sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 1;     // number of bytes used
      bool is_stack: 1;
      size_t capacity: sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 1; // number of bytes available
      bool is_not_inline: 1;
    };
  };
} agxbuf;
```

By splitting `.location` across two discontiguous bits, we regain 63 bits (resp 31 bits) of both `.size` and `.capacity`. The cost here is a more complex location determination. It is not valid to look at the `.is_stack` bit until you have examined the `.is_not_inline` bit. If the `.is_not_inline` bit is not set, the `.is_stack` bit is part of the string itself, not part of the location determination. Once again, the polarity of the inline bit (that we choose `0b0` to mean inline rather than `0b1`) is chosen to give us a natural NUL terminator.

## More advanced packing

```c
typedef struct {
  union {
    char raw[sizeof(char*) + sizeof(size_t)];
    struct {
      char *buf;        // start of buffer
      size_t metadata;  // size, capacity, location
    };
  };
} agxbuf;
```

Here we've lost all structure, so I'll have to explain in words the encoding I have in mind. The top two bits of `.metadata` determine the location. `0b00` mean inline (we retain our natural NUL terminator property), `0b01` mean stack, `0b1x` mean heap. It seems strange that I've put an `x` (""don't care"") there and made both `0b10` and `0b11` mean heap, but we'll get to an explanation.

Once you chop off the top 2 bits of `.metadata`, the next set bit determines the capacity shifted left by 1. So e.g. if, after the top 2 bits, the next  set is way down in bit 16, the capacity of the buffer is 2¹⁵ bytes. The size of the buffer is the remaining bits below this. If you think about this for a while, you'll note this is taking advantage of the invariant that capacity ≥ size.

Checking for when we're about to exhaust the buffer has become a bit more complicated. And the buffer capacity can now only ever be a power of 2. So why are we using this bizarre encoding scheme? Well it drops the overall size of the structure by `sizeof(size_t)`. On x86-64 Linux, the struct will now fit in the in-register calling convention (though it's unclear how often we actually pass one of these by value).

I promised you an explanation of the cryptic `0b1x` encoding for heap. Well the scheme I've just described sacrifices 2 bits: we're back down to a maximum capacity of 2⁶⁰ (2²⁸ resp). We only expect buffers this large, if ever, on the heap. So by making the low bit of the heap encoding ""don't care"" we gain an extra bit, back up to 2⁶¹ (2²⁹ resp).

## Closing thoughts

The final iteration of this design above is so complex, we probably want to avoid it. But I wanted to lay it out anyway, as a thought exercise in how far we can push this.

We probably shouldn't do any of these before some profiling. But nevertheless I thought I should outline (no pun intended) my thoughts rather than let them continue to roll around uncritiqued in my head.

Let's see some more octagons with margin-zero:
```
graph Y {
  rankdir=LR
  node[margin=""0.0,0.0""]
  foo1 [shape=octagon, label=""ab\na""]
  foo3 [shape=octagon, label=""abcd\nabc""]
  foo5 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdef\nabcde""]
  foo7 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefgh\nabcdefg""]
  foo9 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefghij\nabcdefghi""]
  foo11 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefghijkl\nabcdefghijk""]
  foo13 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefghijklmn\nabcdefghijklm""]

  foo17 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefghijklmnopqr\nabcdefghijklmnopq""]
  foo19 [shape=octagon, label=""abcdefghijklmnopqrst\nabcdefghijklmnopqrs""]
}
```
Many of these have passable vertical margins, but overly-wide horizontal ones:

2310,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2310","SVG output should link edges to nodes","## Summary

SVGs, regardless of layout, currently consist of node and edge elements that are placed independently on the canvas. That makes them extremely finicky to adjust with manual tweaking (such as in Inkscape) without edges becoming disconnected from their nodes.

It is possible to generate more tool-friendly SVGs in this respect. Namely, the behavior I would most like to see is an approach paraellel to what iGraph employs:
- Nodes and Edges are added as separate layers in the SVG.
- Edges are linked to Nodes via Inkscape's `diagram connector` mechanism

Those two features, together, give users the ability to edit the SVG output in Inkscape when necessary without garbling up its component elements, but also do so _without_ affecting the SVG's readability to read-only tools.

### Quick background

I'm a postgraduate research student currently caught right in between GraphViz and iGraph for a few key bits. GraphViz's output (unlike igraph) preserves `class` attributes, which is fantastic, but I also periodically need to manually make tweaks to graph layout (which puts me in the reverse bind: igraph supports it, but erases the attributes on the nodes and edges).

## Documentation of desired behavior

This is the issue in which the iGraph team implemented the SVG modifications mentioned above:
https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/246

This is some Inkscape documentation about the ""diagram connector"" type:
https://archive.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/toolbox/connector-tool.html
https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/Connector_tool_tutorial

I am, of course, aware that this element is not part of the original SVG spec (although that could change); however, it is an extension and the Inkscape-specific parts are ignored, in my tests, by other SVG renderers. And, I suppose, it's worth also noting that Inkscape is FOSS and thus is not locking-in the user or the document.

## OS Version

Personally I run Linux; mostly Ubuntu LTS, at the moment 22.04, but I think this is corss-platform.

2311,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2311","Change vertical line spacing in multi-line label","Hi,

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask questions. I would like to be able to fine-tune the spacing between lines in a multi-line label. My label mixes font weights and as a result, is specified with HTML tags. Each new line is obtained using a `<BR/>` tag. However a single `<BR/>` produces a space that is too small for the font I'm using (Futura Std) resulting in a bit of overlap between lines. Two `<BR/>` tags produce too big a space between lines. I haven't been able to find anything in the documentation that explains how to control the line vertical spacing or line height.

Is it at all doable? If so, what would you recommend?

This looks like classic Graphviz micro-optimization code; branching for the case in which the (assumed expensive) calls to math functions will be redundant. I.e. the rounding and trigonometry calls are an expensive way just to compute `50`. Except this is not true. `cos(0.0)` is `1`. So it seems like `ifx` should really be `100` here.

Looking at 2f6d5b337fb2032e2dc2bfd64e33e87ce307c88c that introduced this code, it makes this assumption (that `cos(0.0) == 0`) in 3 separate places.

Is this a bug? I don't know much about radial gradients, so maybe an angle of 0° is somehow a degenerate case where the `x` value is irrelevant.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-11-13 00:07:14.174-05","2022-11-13 00:07:36.986-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"
2314,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2314","gradientangle can't apply to individual nodes, only to `node []`","So this is a strange bug.

We were recently looking at `gradientangle`, and I saw the example was pretty strange, it would set up a default value for all nodes, then just use it on a single node at a time:

```
		node [shape = circle,style=filled,fillcolor=""white:black"",
			gradientangle=360 label=""n9:360"" fontcolor=""black"" ] ""n9""; 
		node [gradientangle=315 label=""n8:315""] ""n8""; 
```

Instead of the more natural, defining the property directly on the node:

```
		n9 [shape = circle,style=filled,fillcolor=""white:black"",
			gradientangle=360 label=""n9:360"" fontcolor=""black"" ];
		n8 [gradientangle=315 label=""n8:315""];

I thought this was just a case of silliness, and updated the example to use the latter: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io/-/commit/c2573588ca17e7a660a9debd4b704a8b70f08936

But tonight, looking through the code of `gradientangle`, I saw that I don't think the latter actually works!

There are two places we parse `gradientangle`. 1 in `input.c` (one for the graph default, one for the `node` default), and one for the HTML lexer (which isn't in play here, we aren't parsing HTML-like labels):

```
> rg \""gradientangle\""
lib/common/input.c
743:    G_gradientangle = agfindgraphattr(g,""gradientangle"");
779:    N_gradientangle = agfindnodeattr(g,""gradientangle"");

lib/common/htmllex.c
486:    {""gradientangle"", (attrFn) gradientanglefn},
511:    {""gradientangle"", (attrFn) gradientanglefn},

There is no handling of `gradientangle` for individual nodes, only as a ""node default"".

## OS Version

I initially tried the latest version of qt6.4.2 to compile, but it seems that QT_SELECT=5 limits the qt version, so I deleted qt6 and changed to qt 5.14.2, but this error still occurs.

There are no code examples, the source code is not provided, and an extensive google search has not yielded anything. In particular, it is not covered anywhere how the new ""striped"" and ""wedged"" style attributes can be used. A bit of trial and error has landed me at ```style = ""striped""; fillcolor = ""lightpink;0.5:lightyellow""```--so it is it just a colorList with separating black lines? See https://graphviz.org/docs/attr-types/colorList/. It is also not obvious that there is a way to combine multiple styles, e.g., ```style = ""bold,rounded,striped""```.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2022-12-03 00:08:56.322-05","2022-12-03 00:01:12.666-05","[]","[]","[]","[]"
2325,"https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/2325","unsafe retained pointers in 'parse_style'","`parse_style` uses an agxbuf with initial local storage:

```c
static char outbuf[SMALLBUF];
static agxbuf ps_xb;
…
agxbinit(&ps_xb, SMALLBUF, outbuf);
```

It then goes on to both write data into this agxbuf as well as retain internal pointers into the buffer:

```c
  parse[fun++] = agxbnext(&ps_xb);
}
agxbput_n(&ps_xb, c.start, c.size);
```

However an agxbuf with external storage like this can switch to being heap allocated if too much data is pushed into it. For example, it looks to me like the following sequence of actions can occur:

1. `ps_xb` is initialized with `outbuf` living at 0x1000
2. enough data is pushed into `ps_xb` to almost fill `outbuf`
3. the above line takes a pointer into `ps_xb`, finding `agxbnext(&ps_xb)` to be 0x103e
4. a greater-than-2-byte string is immediately pushed into it in the next line, `agxbput_n(&ps_xb, c.start, c.size)`, causing `ps_xb` to be relocated to the heap

Now the last entry of `parse` that we wrote (`parse[fun++]`) contains a pointer to a garbage _unterminated_ string. This most likely goes on to cause a difficult-to-debug crash when a read later walks off the end of this string.

Compounding this problem, there's a variant of the same issue where `ps_xb` has _already_ been heap allocated but is expanded by the call to `agxbput_n`. In this case, we've retained not a pointer to an unterminated string but a pointer into now-freed data. In fact _all prior_ pointers in the `parse` array now point into freed data.

This is a pretty severe issue and, given the size of `outbuf` is only 64 bytes, I'm surprising this hasn't caused problems in the past. The leading comment to this function itself is actually quite damning, but its author appears to have not spotted the above described further bug:

```c
/* parse_style:
 * This is one of the worst internal designs in graphviz.
 * The use of '\0' characters within strings seems cute but it
 * makes all of the standard functions useless if not dangerous.
 * Plus the function uses static memory for both the array and
 * the character buffer. One hopes all of the values are used
 * before the function is called again.

Unfortunately what I overlooked at the time was that the `agxbput` introduced in this commit bottoms out in a `memcpy` with overlapping destination and source, something that is undefined behavior in C.

The obvious fix to this would be to adjust `agxbput` to call `memmove` instead of `memcpy`.

This input file does not respect the order of the nodes. For the trees represents AST, left sides of the '=' sign only could contain a single word/variable name. Not multiple or a number. Remove pack=1 and this order is correctly, while this should not be an influence as far as I know.

Incorrect order of child nodes.

The line numbers are actually 175-177 and correctly have the same coverage. Lines 181-183 are not the lines indicated by GitLab.

![image](/uploads/3873b3c891ad453860c9491821a655f8/image.png)

This shows the same as the lcov report.

Checking out the https://gitlab.com/smattr/graphviz/-/tree/smattr/gitlab-1950 branch and checking the line numbers with an external editor shows that the lcov and gcov line numbers are correct and the line numbers in the GitLab UI are wrong.

Indeed, I tried profiling -Tcanon with https://github.com/mstange/samply:

```
$ samply record --rate 100 /usr/local/bin/dot -Tcanon ~/Downloads/dot-causes-abend.dot
```

And I see it's spending a lot of time in dotLayout function: https://share.firefox.dev/3vNpo1k

I don't think this is particularly important, but I thought I'd file it here to track as an issue: `-Tcanon` is the closest thing to an autoformatter (a la gofmt/rustfmt) that we have for Graphviz. And autoformatters should be fast. Maybe we could skip the layout if we're doing `-Tcanon`.

This is sort of analogous to a violation of C++’s One Definition Rule (ODR). What’s happening is that the definition of the underlying struct of the typedef `Sfio_t`, `_sfio_s`, is seen twice, once with `_SFIO_PRIVATE` defined and once without. So different parts of the compilation see a different struct behind `Sfio_t`. Normally the compiler is blind to this because the differences occur between translation units. But LTO allows it to see across this boundary.

The risk of a problem here is relatively low (most `Sfio_t` usage is by pointer only), but we should probably address this for the sake of avoiding future miscompilations as compiler optimizations become more aggressive.",NULL,NULL,"closed",NULL,"2023-01-10 00:06:57.853-05","2023-01-22 00:06:52.768-05","[""bug""]","[]","[]","[]"

The following code is taken from https://www.graphviz.org/Gallery/undirected/fdpclust.html. This example shows that edges from one subgraph cluster to another are supported in layout program fdp.

```
graph G {
  fontname=""Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif""
  node [fontname=""Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif""]
  edge [fontname=""Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif""]
  layout=fdp
  e
  subgraph clusterA {
    a -- b;
    subgraph clusterC {
      C -- D;
    }
  }
  subgraph clusterB {
    d -- f
  }
  d -- D
  e -- clusterB
  clusterC -- clusterB
}
```
I modified this code and changed `layout=fdp` to `layout=dot`. Consequently, the edge from `ClusterC` -- `ClusterB` no longer exists after compiling, and instead, the program incorrectly renders new nodes `ClusterB` and `ClusterC` and connects them.

## Expected Behaviour
The desired expected behavior is to observe an edge connecting `ClusterC` and `ClusterB` as it was done in the fdp layout program.

The Python code in the repository is not a core part of Graphviz, so I don't think this proposal is controversial. But applying it will incur a large diff, mainly due to the migration from 2-space indenting to 4-space indenting. But I think the pay off is worth it.

```

The assignment to `ltp` is storing a pointer into the global `tris` array. This array is realloced in `loadtriangle`, potentially relocating its backing memory. So the following sequence of events is possible:
1. `loadtriangle` is called
2. `growtris` is called, and allocates `tris` at 0x42
3. 0x42 (a pointer to the 0-th entry) is stored into `ltp`
4. 20 further calls to `loadtriangle` happen
5. `loadtriangle` is called
6. `growtris` is called because the array is now full; its `realloc` moves the array to 0x80

`ltp` is now a dangling pointer into freed memory at 0x42 and it may be dereferenced later.

Running the equivalent steps locally, I can reproduce the failure. Locally I get no output at all, not even the cryptic “suppressions used…” text.

Both contain an optimization to avoid a recursive call when the chunk they’re sorting is already sorted. However the neatogen implementation additionally performs the two recursive calls before these checks:

```c
quicksort_place(place, ordering, first, middle - 1); // ← unconditional sort already
quicksort_place(place, ordering, middle + 1, last);  // being performed

// these conditions will now always evaluate false

Compile the attached [Source.gv](/uploads/3d8466291014163004a06e78e2a3a742/Source.gv) with `dot -Tsvg Source.gv > Source.svg`.

## Description

In the generated graph, there are seven (7) rows, each made of a subgraph. Note that clusters will not work here because I desire edges crossing over subgraph. The first six (6) subgraphs, labeled A-F, should contain horizontal lines that connect the nodes of the subgraph. The nodes are numbered `0..N` (depending on the subgraph) and connected `0 -> 1 -> 2 ... -> N` from left to right. The seventh (7th) subgroup is just a collection of unrelated notes that look pretty when drawn in a horizontal line, thus they are grouped together.

In addition to the horizontal subgroup edges, there are some edges that traverse from one subgraph to another. These are allowed to cross over other edges. The internal edges (i.e. one between nodes in the same subgraph) of subgraphs `A-C, E-F` behave correctly, but subgraph `D`'s internal nodes and edges ""go crazy"". Specifically, nodes 2 and 3 are swapped such that the placement from left to right is `D0, D1, D3, D2, D4`, causing edges `D1:e -> D2:w`, `D2:e -> D3:w`, and `D3:e -> D4:w` to take suboptimal routes. Instead of short, straight, horizontal lines, they are bendy/curvy abominations.

The attached DOT source is a real graph (i.e. a production asset), but I have stripped all the additional attributes (labels, URLs, colors, height/width, etc.). The same graphic anomaly occurs when all the lipstick is applied, but this test-case is (hopefully) a tad easier to read. Additionally, this sighting occurs in other graphs as well. The more edges that cross over subgraphs, the more likely `dot` is to make a strange decision.

## Actual Behaviour

What follows is the actual result of the DOT file included below:

![Actual.svg](/uploads/7f10bcb80baf5d29e62934b0deba4ebc/Actual.svg)

## Expected Behaviour

A more reasonable graph is produced when `constraint=false` is applied to edge `D2 -> Y`. Unfortunately this is not a valid solution, as this graph is one of an infinite number of graphs generated on-the-fly from a constantly-evolving dataset. But this small manual tweak does produce a more visually appealing graph.

## OS Version / Graphviz Version

I confirmed the same input generates roughly the same output on the following configurations:

- CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810, dot - graphviz version 2.40.1 (20161225.0304)
- CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810, dot - graphviz version 7.1.0 (20230121.1956)
- CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810, dot - graphviz version 8.0.1 (20230327.1645)
- MacOS Ventura 13.2.1 - dot - graphviz version 8.0.1 (20230327.1645)

## Additional information

In some scenarios, I have luck performing a little post-processing and iterative rewiring of the graph. To do this, I:
- Render DOT -> placed DOT (`dot -Tdot in > out`) which outputs a DOT file with `pos` attributes on all nodes and edges.
- Detect nodes in a subgraph that are not placed in the proper order.
- Shuffle the `dot`-generated `pos` attributes to redistribute the nodes in the desired order.
  - In the 'Actual' graph above, this equates to swapping the `pos` attributes for nodes `D2` and `D3`.
- Find all edges that begin/end at the relocated nodes and remove their `pos` attributes.
- Render DOT -> DOT again (`neato -Tdot -n2 in > out`)
  - Sometimes this needs to be done iteratively -- first I break and then reroute the ""vertical"" edges (the ones that traverse from one subgraph to another, e.g. `A2 -> Y` which travels north-to-south over the `D1 -> D2 -> D3` region), then I break/re-reoute the ""horizontal"" edges (e.g. `D1 -> D2, D2 -> D3, D3 -> D4`).
  - For this specific graph, `neato` goes into an infinite loop when trying to re-route either `D2 -> D3` or `D3 -> D4`. In other graphs, this approach works wonderfully

This is most definitely a hack, and not a pretty one.

Other techniques I have tried include pre-computing the number of vertical edge crossings in the north-source (e.g. `A2 -> Y`, `D4 -> A4`, etc.), apply a weighting factor to each crossing based on domain-specific knowledge of the input data-set, and then re-ordering all but the bottom-most subgraph in order to minimize the number of edge crossing. This works sometimes, but not all of the time.
